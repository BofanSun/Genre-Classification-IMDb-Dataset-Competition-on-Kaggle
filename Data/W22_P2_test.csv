11338," Coming from an upper-middle class background with a good education, close friends and family members (she has one adolescent daughter), 37 year old Canadian Lisa seemed to be the least likely person to get caught up in the dangerous and self-destructive world of crack addiction and prostitution (which is how she funds her habit). She discusses in a very honest, open and articulate manner here in the film's intimate setting (her Toronto hotel room to be precise) just what led her down this tragic path that she currently finds herself in, and how she ultimately wants nothing more than to reach full sobriety someday so as to not only return to some semblance of a normal life as a mother, daughter and friend but to hopefully educate and help others, specifically women, who have found themselves in a similar situation as hers."

11580," PIIGS is a documentary that challenges prevalent European budgetary policies and the austerity dogma. It does so by bringing in lesser-known facts and evidence that have the effect of ridiculing prevalent European monetary policies and dominant political certainties. Did you know that the famous god-like Stability and Growth Pact with its 3% deficit limit and theories about critical government debt levels are based on purely invented figures and typing errors in Excel spreadsheet? However, austerity policies keep on dividing the continent into winners and loosers, creating great amount of suffering, particularly in so-called crisis countries. Consequently, the whole European project has become in doubt. PIIGS is a Southern European take into austerity dogma and states with the voice of prestigious international economists, intellectuals and experts, that the origin of the European debt crisis is not the inadequacy of people in crisis countries but the very foundation of euro itself. Unfortunately people are not immune to bad decision making, and the documentary shows how austerity turns into practice in Rome, focusing on a survival story of a cooperative assisting disabled people."

The hazards and consequences of this trade are explored, including the pan-African violence propagated by constant flow of weapons into the continent. If it is a ""survival of the fittest"" world, as Darwin concluded, then the capitalist interests that fund the gun runners are climbing the evolutionary ladder on the backs of the Africans in this stark Darwinian example. Much like the foreseeable extinction of the Lake Victoria perch, and death of Lake Victoria itself, the Africans are in grave jeopardy, even as they survive in the only ways they know how. In the 1950s or 1960s, the Nile perch was released into the Lake Victoria. In just a few decades, the large, voracious predator has all but eliminated the other species of fish, turning the lake into an ecological wasteland.

Fishermen, factory workers, civil servants, pilots of cargo aircrafts, delegates of the European Commission, communities living around Lake Victoria: plenty of people are involved in some way in this new industry. But if Africa exports hundreds of tons of premium-priced fish each day, what exactly do Africans get in return?"

As a society we devote a great deal of attention to treating cancer, but very little to treating the human being who is dying of cancer. The recent resurgence of psychedelic research is once again revealing the power of compounds like psilocybin to profoundly alter our understanding of both life and death. Through the eyes of patients, their loved ones, therapists, and researchers, A New Understanding examines the use of psilocybin in a controlled setting to reduce psychospiritual anxiety, depression, and physical pain. The treatment aims to help the patient understand that a 'good' death is possible, and to help the patient's family deal well with the dying process. A New Understanding shows patients and their families coming to terms with dying through the skillful treatment of the whole human being. If we can learn to work more skillfully with dying, we will also learn to take better care of life."

Who were the gods of the past in the various religions? ? What do the Plejaren say about Obama? ? What's the truth about skeptics who now claim to have duplicated Meier's photos and films? ? How does reincarnation work if you were an extraterrestrial, in a distant past life, who came here? ? How and why did we need seven prophets to bring the spiritual teaching to us? ? Why didn't the Plejaren offer of contact with the Jimmy Carter administration, in 1979, succeed? ? What's the truth about the Roswell androids, secret military craft the UFO cover-up? ?

10018," IBM employees are curious. We try to seek out relationships that lead to expanding our knowledge in exciting areas of innovation and thought. When we engage with experts from outside our company, we take the time to listen, the time to think, we ask questions. Sometimes we find ourselves in these situations where - if we approach with respect and an open ear - we afford ourselves the opportunity to collaborate, to further the conversation, to build valuable relationships. We are a global network of experts seeking to further our innovative insight through our innate curiosity, our collaborative nature, and our respect for the work and achievements of others. As an example of this, a handful of IBMers over the last few years have visited the MIT SENSEable City Laboratory in Cambridge Massachusetts to meet with the students and faculty members there, and to learn about some of the innovative projects they have underway. Just as IBM has been exploring how to make our cities more instrumented, interconnected and intelligent, the folks at MIT have been investigating and testing their own ideas in a number of cities over the last 6 years. Their projects are fascinating. One project from the SENSEable Cities Lab that has caught the eye of many IBMers over the past few years is called Trash Track. In a nutshell, this project involved attaching RFID tags to everyday garbage items so that the geographic movement of the trash could be tracked for up to a year depending on variables. An Internet of Things project of sorts, with mapping, analytics, and ultimately analysis of the tags as attached to their hosts traveling about -- glass, metals, plastics, organic waste etc -- this project provided unique and surprising lessons for all involved. In hearing about this project, IBM Fellow John Cohn agreed to take a trip to the MIT campus -- his alma mater -- to participate in a discussion with SENSEable Cities Associate Director Assaf Biderman to learn more about Trash Track. This video is the result of that trip, and some of the things we learned that day."

10921," ""POSTCARD FROM THE EDGE"" is a short but intimate portrait of the Dutch painter MARCELLE HANSELAAR directed by German filmmaker and artist Thomas V枚lker. The film was made on the occasion of Hanselaar's Solo Show ""Walking The Line"" which took place at Kings Place Gallery London between May and June 2013. From the exhibition catalogue: Marcelle Hanselaar's familiar theme, the conflicting awareness and subsequent struggle with the balance of how we see ourselves and how we appear to others, has now found a bigger arena. Her gripping paintings of a solitary figure, with or without props are still there but now, for the first time, she takes this theme into the public realm, something she has freely explored in her large etchings but never before in her paintings. The result is a Breughel-esque tableau vivant. Hanselaar says ""I am fascinated by the phenomena of crowds, how the shift from private to collective behavior creates a shift of inner boundaries as well. Our familiar sense of inner and outer or personal and social responsibilities and its subsequent behavior shrinks and expands simultaneously and creates, temporarily, a different set of references from which we then function."" Marcelle Hanselaar has won many awards both for her prints and her paintings. Her work is in important public collections including the British Museum, the Victoria & Albert Museum, the National Art Library and the Ruth Borchard Self-Portrait Collection."

Their quest is complicated by Fogell's falling in with two inept cops who both slow and assist the plan. If they do get the liquor to the party, what then? Is sex the only rite of passage at hand?

14296," Guy Gabaldon died on August 31, 2006 and the world lost someone very special. During the bloody struggle for Saipan in July 1944, U.S. Marine PFC Guy Gabaldon is indeed officially credited with capturing over 1500 Japanese soldiers and civilians - singlehandedly, a record that is untouchable in the annals of American military history. For over sixty years, Guy talked about his exploits on that island, sharing his experience and using his celebrity to inspire new generations who valued bravery and bravado. However, war experience alone does not make a life, and Guy's didn't stop in 1944. He lived many different lives and most importantly he took it upon himself to help the less fortunate, particularly the wayward teenagers he encountered when he returned to the Mariana Islands in 1980, where he would live for twenty years. Guy Gabaldon grew up in East Los Angeles where he spent more time on the streets than at home. He would get into fights and he was thrown out of school at one point, but things began to change when he was introduced to the Japanese American community. Practically adopted by his Nisei school friends, Guy learned about the Japanese culture, its language, and the tight family structure that was alien to him. All of these elements - learned at first hand - would have a dramatic effect on his experiences on Saipan. When his Japanese American friends were interned after Pearl Harbor, Guy, 17, joined the Marine Corps, trained at Camp Pendleton, and was assigned as a scout to the 2nd Regiment of the 2nd Marine Division. His unit was then shipped to Hawaii, and then on into the Central Pacific, where he landed on Saipan, nine days after D-Day in Europe. Saipan was a rocky, cave-strewn island in the Mariana chain. It was part of the Japanese Empire's inner defense perimeter and it had an airfield within striking distance of Japan. It also had a large civilian population of Japanese and native islanders. The American high command in the Pacific had determined that the Marianas - Guam, Tinian and Saipan were a high priority for the war effort. B-29s were now flying and they needed a base to attack Japan. Saipan fit that bill. Guy Gabaldon didn't set out to be a hero. In the first few days of heavy fighting, he simply tried to survive murderous mortar, artillery and machine gun fire. But in succeeding days, he began to go on lone-wolf excursions into the countryside and he brought prisoners back. Japanese prisoners were a bit of an oddity at that time. The credo of most soldiers of the Japanese Army was kill or be killed. Japanese soldiers on Saipan were ordered to kill seven Marines for one Japanese. Thus, the campaign featured one suicide banzai charge after another. Capturing one Japanese was considered a feat - bringing in 1500 was unthinkable. But, amazingly, that's exactly what Guy Gabaldon did during the two months of early fighting on Saipan. At one point, he captured 800 in one day - his commanding officer Captain John Schwabe would later dub him ""The Pied Piper of Saipan."" How did Guy do it? Perhaps it was his language skill - Guy was hardly fluent in Japanese but he spoke the language with a certain inflection that reached into the psyche of the exhausted, hopelessly outnumbered island garrison. He had learned the words on the streets of L.A. with his Japanese-American friends, and those words helped him on the island. Perhaps it was the fact that the Japanese were, in the end, human beings who just couldn't fight anymore. Timing was thus everything. Guy wasn't hesitant to make a point with a hand grenade of a carbine if the enemy proved stubborn. But they eventually came out of their caves and became his prisoner. Guy was later wounded after the island was secured. Astonishingly, he was denied the Congressional Medal of Honor - a medal for which he was recommended by Captain Schwabe of the 2nd Marines. He did receive the Silver Star for his valor, but he was not promoted and left the Marine service as a PFC. Being Hispanic, perhaps, didn't help his cause. Racism and prejudice was rife throughout the U.S. armed forces in World War II and Guy was not immune to it. Guy returned to the United States, married a Japanese woman who was living in Mexico and became a successful pilot and importer. His story was first told on the television program ""This is your Life"" in the late 1950s. That program came to the attention of Hollywood and a movie was produced in 1960 entitled ""Hell to Eternity."" Actor Jeffrey Hunter played Guy. Hunter was your poster boy U.S. Marine - no reference was ever made to his Guy's Hispanic ethnicity. However, the notoriety of the film at that time encouraged the U.S. Navy to award Guy its highest decoration - the Navy Cross. But no Medal of Honor. Today, a strong effort is being waged by Congressmen, private business people and friends of Guy to get him the Medal. It would be measured as a sign of respect, not only to Guy, but to the people in America of Hispanic descent. Production Production on ""East L.A. Marine"" commenced in late 2003. Guy Gabaldon was enlisted as a creative partner on the project, and he was interviewed, at length, at his home outside Gainsville, Florida. We later interviewed his commanding officer, U.S. Marine Colonel John Schwabe, at his winter home in Tucson, Arizona. In June 2004, during the 60th Anniversary celebrations on Saipan, a local DV crew was hired and footage was gathered all over the island. Seventeen additional interviews were completed with returning veterans, local historians and friends of Guys. Guy and his wife had returned to the Island and lived there for many years - so he was well known throughout the Marianas. His autobiographical book Maverick Marine was published in 1990. Much of the footage that was gathered on the island is designed to match combat footage and still photographs taken of the campaign (yesterday and today shots). In early 2005, we interviewed a number of Hispanic veterans in Montebello, California. That May, we met Guy in Corpus Christi, Texas and helped celebrate Memorial Day with him. Footage of Guy participating in solemn commemorative ceremonies combined with nostalgic trips to the U.S.S. Lexington - a U.S. Essex-class aircraft carrier, that participated in the invasion of Saipan, sixty one years ago. In July 2006, Guy was honored by Mayor Antonio Villagairosa and the Los Angeles City Council. He was indeed a ""favorite son"" of the City of Los Angeles. This is the story of an extraordinary man - Guy Gabaldon - a U.S. Marine of Hispanic descent who single-handedly captured over 1100 Japanese during the bloody fighting on Saipan in the summer of 1944. One of the legendary heroes of World War II, Guy Gabaldon's true story is now told for the very first time in EAST L.A. MARINE: THE UNTOLD TRUE STORY OF GUY GABALDON. Guy Gabaldon's roots date back to the time of the Spanish conquistadors in New Mexico. Born in Los Angeles, Guy grew up in Boyle Heights where he spent more time on the streets than at home. He would get into fights and he was thrown out of school at one point, but things began to change when he was introduced to the Japanese American community. Practically adopted by his Nisei school friends, Guy learned about the Japanese culture, its language, and the tight family structure that was alien to him. All of these elements - learned at first hand - would have a dramatic effect on his experiences on Saipan. When his Japanese American friends were interned after Pearl Harbor, Guy, 17, joined the Marine Corps, trained at Camp Pendleton, and was assigned as a scout to the 2nd Regiment of the 2nd Marine Division. His combat unit landed on Saipan, nine days after D-Day in Europe. Saipan was a rocky, cave-strewn island in the Mariana chain. Guy Gabaldon didn't set out to be a hero. In the first few days of heavy fighting, he simply tried to survive murderous mortar, artillery and machine gun fire. But in succeeding days, he began to go on lone-wolf excursions into the countryside and he brought prisoners back. Japanese prisoners were an oddity at that time. The credo of most soldiers of the Japanese Army was kill or be killed. Japanese soldiers on Saipan were ordered to kill seven Marines for one Japanese. Thus, the campaign featured one suicide banzai charge after another. Capturing one Japanese was considered a feat - bringing in over 1500 was unthinkable. But, amazingly, that's exactly what Guy Gabaldon did during the two months of early fighting on Saipan. At one point, he captured 800 in one day - his commanding officer Captain John Schwabe would later dub him ""The Pied Piper of Saipan."" Guy was later wounded after the island was secured. Astonishingly, he was denied the Congressional Medal of Honor - a medal for which he was recommended by Captain Schwabe of the 2nd Marines. He did receive the Silver Star for his valor, but he was not promoted and left the Marine service as a PFC. Being Hispanic, perhaps, didn't help his cause. Racism and prejudice was rife throughout the U.S. armed forces in World War II and Guy was not immune to it. Fifteen years after the end of World War II, Guy's story was dramatized in the 1960 war film, HELL TO ETERNITY. Since there were no Hispanic leading men at that time, producer Irvin Levin decided to cast Jeffrey Hunter as Guy. Hunter was 6'1"" and Caucasian, a poster-boy Marine type. In reality, Guy ""Gabby"" Gabaldon was 5' 3 3/4"" and of Hispanic descent - an important facet of Guy's life that was ignored in the film. Although nicely written by Ted Sherdeman and directed in slam bang style by Phil Karlson (the movie was the first to feature on-screen squib bullet hits on bodies), much of the story was invented and the manner in which General Matsui (""Bridge on the River Kwai's"" Sessue Hayakawa) personally ordered the whole island to surrender to Guy was ludicrous. One positive aspect of HELL TO ETERNITY was that it woke up the Marine Corps to Gabaldon's contribution and he was awarded the Navy Cross at El Toro Marine Air Station in 1960. However, any effort to get the Corps to endorse the Congressional Medal of Honor was stymied. Guy Lewis Gabaldon died of a heart attack on August 31, 2006. He was 80. Today, a strong effort is being waged by Congressmen, private business people and friends of Guy to get him the Medal posthumously. It would be measured as a sign of respect, not only to Guy, but to the people in America of Hispanic descent who fought in World War II. ###"

Artist were utilized to document the new frontier. They painted pictures and drew sketches of the west. The greatest significance from this was establishing history for the American Indian, The Mountain Men, and the West in general. They replicated in precise detail the colors, expressions, and way of life which was about to drastically change. As settlers moved in from the east, they brought with them their own way of life that would alter the manner in which the American Indians had lived for a thousand or more years. Likewise they documented the mountain men which was a short lived era, approximately 20 years. Artist George Catlin, Alfred Jacob Miller and others of this era knew that the way of life for the American Indian would rapidly change with the influence of white settlers. Their paintings record the American Indian dress, behavior, and lifestyle in detail just prior to the change that was so rapidly to take place.

The demand for access to affordable treatment for 40 million people living with HIV, most of whom live in poor countries, represents one of the most successful political movements of contemporary history. This documentary examines critical junctures in the battle for access to HIV treatment as the poorest and most marginalized individuals confront larger powers, including governments, corporate bodies and a multinational drug industry that is motivated by profit. The fight for AIDS drugs is taking place in tandem with a growing anti-globalization movement; the latter provides a backdrop for examining AIDS through a lens of poverty, socioeconomic injustice and human rights. At the heart of this documentary is a thorny question: Can the world afford universal HIV treatment? At what cost? What will be the global cost if we fail to treat and save 40 million people now? Pills, Profits and Protest are the three thematic touchstones of our film, each reflecting an important aspect of the current battle. Behind this movement are people, personalities and lives.

Established in 1930, the colony was governed by an isolation policy that severely restricted the civil liberties of the residents; the policy was finally lifted in the mid-1950's.

15538," The Duchy of Grand Fenwick, the smallest country in the world, is nestled in the French Alps. Being as isolated as it is, its life is a throwback to olden days. It is a happy, peace-loving country. Its economy solely rests on export of its only wine, Pinot Grand Fenwick, to the US. When a California vintner starts producing and selling a knock-off of the Pinot Grand Fenwick at a lower price, the Grand Fenwick economy goes into a crisis situation, the country on the brink of bankruptcy. Three protests to the US go largely unanswered. Grand Fenwick's Prime Minister, Rupert of Mountjoy, believes the solution is to declare war on the US, and promptly lose the war in less than a day with no casualties on either side, after which the US, which it has historically done, will provide vast financial aide to rebuild the country. Grand Fenwick's monarch, the Grand Duchess Gloriana XII, ultimately supports this concept. The plan is to send an official declaration of war to the US, have a small army of approximately twenty sail from Marseilles to New York City, and the army immediately surrendering when they can't enter the US without visas anyway. Although seen as a hapless man, the person to lead the mission is Tully Bascombe, who inherited the roles of Grand Fenwick's head forest ranger, head field marshal and grand constable of the armed forces, which still uses longbows and arrows as their weapon. The Prime Minister and Duchess believe that even Tully cannot screw up losing the war. But things do not go according to plan, due largely to the US official receiving the declaration believing it to be a gag, and events happening in New York City the day the army arrives leading to the army having no one to surrender to. Things take a further turn when Tully believes that they can actually win the war by kidnapping Doctor Alfred Kokintz and his q-bomb - which is exponentially more deadly than the h-bomb - which he is developing for the US. This move by Tully leads to an all-out global crisis. In the process, they need to also kidnap Kokintz's daughter, Helen Kokintz, with who Tully falls in love, but who sees in Tully solely a criminal. Even the greatest diplomatic minds may not be able to figure a way out of this crisis, especially with Tully on the scene. The tiny Duchy of Grand Fenwick, in the French Alps, is the smallest country of the world and its economy is supported by the exportation of their wine Pinot Grand Fenwick. When the producers from California fake Grand Fenwick's wine and sells a knock-off at a lower price, the country becomes bankrupt. The Prime Minister Count Rupert of Mountjoy sends three protests to the United States that are not answered. Then he proposes that Grand Fenwick declares war upon the United States and immediately surrender since the Americans historically support any defeated nation after war to rebuild the country. Grand Duchess Gloriana XII and the government supports the idea and the clumsy forest ranger Tully Bascombe is promoted to Field Marshal and sails to New York with a twenty-men army armed with bow and arrow. Meanwhile the American government is testing the ""Q-Bomb"", which is more powerful than any nuclear weapon and capable of destroying the world, and the New Yorkers are hidden in shelters as part of the drill. Tully and his men arrive in a deserted New York and accidentally stumble upon the bomb and its creator, Doctor Alfred Kokintz, and his gorgeous daughter Helen Kokintz and Tully abducts them together with a general and four police officers. Now Grand Fenwick government has a huge problem since many countries are offering their support to the tiny count to have the ""Q-Bomb"". What will they do? The Duchy of Grand Fenwick decides that the only way to get out of their economic woes is to declare war on the United States, lose and accept foreign aid. They send an invasion force to New York (armed with longbows) which arrives during a nuclear drill that has cleared the streets. Wandering about to find someone to surrender to, they discover a scientist with a special ultimate weapon that can destroy the Earth. When they capture him and his bomb they are faced with a new possibility: What do you do when you win a war? The best laid plans of mice and men ... A cold war satire emphasising the newly emerged American superpower's use of foreign aid to buy friends and keep then away from the USSR's influence. Peter Sellers, as the scheming Prime Minister of Grand Fenwick, plots with Peter Sellers, as the scheming Grand Duchess, to declare war on the USA, lose the war and get that foreign aid. Unfortunately, they forget to tell Peter Sellers, as Tully Bascombe, commander of their mediaeval army. This honourable man does his best for his country and, through a series of unbelievable circumstances (well, this is a comedy), to win the war. Now, who has to give aid to whom?"
14302," The film consists of three, at first glance independent, stories and follows three situations developing simultaneously within a few days.

Will it continue its plunge into modernity or reverse course and pursue a more traditionalist path? Will a society steeped in nominal religious affiliation experience a spiritual transformation? What do the Japanese people believe and why? All of these questions and more are explored in this intriguing documentary. Is the sun rising or setting on the Japanese dream? A people who once drew their identity from a sense of community and belonging find themselves going their separate ways.

Clark Wilhelm Griswold had some disastrous vacations at both Wallyworld and in Europe. Now he wants to compensate for this by having a special ""Griswold Family Christmas"", and after months of careful planning he invites both of his parents, both of his wife, Ellen's parents even his uncle Louis and his senile aunt Bethany. However, what Clark does not realize that his no-manner cousin-in law Eddie was coming over in his new trailer. Clark even prepares his house for Christmas with over 20,000 lights and a tree that does not even fit in the living room. As Christmas eve comes, Clark will soon realize that a series of unfortunate events will start to unravel for him, as the Christmas Turkey would burst and have no meat, his aunt's cat would chew on the lights and his uncle Louis will burn up his tree, and he will even soon discover that his boss have cut the Christmas bonus to give him a month in the jelly club, can Clark keep it together and understand the true meaning of Christmas? Chicago resident Clark Wilhelm Griswold Jr has REALLY got the Christmas spirit this year, and his wife Ellen, son Rusty, and daughter Audrey have noticed it. Clark has invited Ellen's parents Arthur Smith and Francis Smith, his own parents Clark Wilhelm Griswold Sr and Nora Griswold, and his Aunt Bethany and Uncle Lewis to spend the holidays at the Griswold house in Chicago. Clark is obsessed with making everything go perfectly during the holiday season, but as soon as everyone arrives, things start going haywire, especially when the Griswolds receive some uninvited surprise guests from Kansas -- cousin Catherine, her sloppy husband Eddie, and two of their kids, Rocky and Ruby Sue. Clark decorates the outside of the house with 250 strands of lights with 100 bulbs on each strand for a total of 25,000 light bulbs, enough to make the power company turn on their auxiliary nuclear generator. Clark also annoys his snobby next door neighbors -- Todd Chester and his wife Margo. Even with his bumbling ways, Clark manages to keep things going as he waits for his Christmas bonus from work so he'll have enough money to have a swimming pool put in the back yard. But it turns out that Clark's boss, a scrooge whose name is Frank Shirley, does not intend to give out any Christmas bonuses this year, and this causes Clark to snap and act crazy. This situation gives Eddie the idea for the perfect Christmas gift for Clark after Clark offers to help Eddie treat Rocky and Ruby Sue to a good Christmas.

Unfortunately, the bonus check Clark expects any minute is overdue - and tempers rise, but not only because of the check. A big event is the arrival of uninvited cousin Eddie with his family in their mobile home, as well as a little sledding afternoon with a new lubricant from Clark's company, or his shifting relationship with the very hip and clean neighbours. Cousin Eddie chooses to top off all presents with his very own special creation, only intending to deliver a real reason to be jolly. This year, Clark Griswold is really into Christmas, and promises his family the best Christmas ever. However, instead of the best Christmas ever, Clark turns Christmas evening completely around, causing a domino effect of disasters that eventually seems to drive everyone crazy."

The first patients to be committed were Holocaust survivors. A legend says that to this day, the survivors have been communicating with the ghosts of the village.

Flashbacks and flashforwards reveal the events that led up to his hospitalization. A 10-year old female ghost holds the secret to the riddle. But only when the secret is revealed can she find rest and give David the option to end a perpetually-repeated destiny...

Because he lives between the world of the dead and the living, Muselmann can act as a conduit between the murdered ghosts and David.

15684," ""You're free. Go home"" Most Holocaust films end with these words, the very words that survivors heard at liberation. After Auschwitz begins with these words, inviting audiences to experience what happened next. For survivors, liberation from the camps was the beginning of a life long struggle. They wanted to go home, but there was no home left in Europe. They came to America and wanted to tell people about their pasts but were silenced for over three decades. ""You're in America now, put it behind you"". After Auschwitz is a ""Post-Holocaust"" documentary that captures what it means to survive and try to life a normal life after unspeakable tragedy. Six extraordinary women who all survived Auschwitz take us on a journey that American audiences have never seen before. These women all moved to Los Angeles, married, raised children and became ""Americans"" but they never truly found a place to call home. What makes the story so much more fascinating is how these women saw, interpreted and interacted with the changing face of America in the second half of the 20th century. They serve as our guides on an unbelievable journey, sometimes celebratory, sometimes heart breaking but always inspiring. It is also the only ""Holocaust"" film that includes Ricardo Montalban, George W. Bush and an appearance at The Kennedy Center Honors.

13690," How far would you go to help a friend? Would you lie? Steal? What if saving your friend meant throwing away a shot at true love while risking your life at the same time? Would you still do it? Benny Hines (Chris Foster) is about to answer those questions. And when he does, his life will never be the same. Until recently, Benny considered himself a good person.

But all that changed when his best friend (Robin Abbott) racked up a $20,000 debt to a cold-blooded loan shark (Florentino Gonzales).

This plan, however, is no longer small time. Each man must risk his life in a dangerous, all-or-nothing scheme. With time running out and their lives in danger, the group's secret plans and growing conflicts explode into a surprise ending, which forces Benny to make the biggest decision of his life: his best friend or his new love. Queens Over Jacks' intricate plot and vivid characters combine to create a story of love, deception, revenge, greed, loyalty, and choices that none of us want to make, yet somehow must."

This lack of stories surrounding the custom led us on one hand to go and meet the oldest women to gather their testimonies and, on the other, to invite them to take part in a liberating and iconoclastic gesture to be undertaken all together in the square. In the main town square, for this is the public space par excellence, where traditionally, women have always been given precious little visibility. Instead in this case, the women actually become performing artists for a brief time. Just to have fun, like those American artists who consecrated gesturing in contemporary art while these women were out breaking their backs in the countryside, or to transcend, like Oriental masters capable in a single move of shifting... a few kilos of tradition."

11789," The story has to do with a crippled child, Carol Bird, the only daughter of her wealthy parents, who are proud of two strong, healthy sons, in addition. Little Carol is a hopeless invalid, and the tender love and affection of the entire family go out to her, fearing the day when the soul shall take its flight from the fragile body. Carol has a devoted Uncle Jack also, a traveler in distant lands, who cheers her by a letter, in which he promises to come home and spend Christmas with her. But little Carol has other friends, outside of her sphere indeed, but nevertheless faithful, loyal friends, who would go any length to spare her pain or to bring her pleasure. These are none other than the nine ragged members of the Ruggles family, little boys and girls who live nearby, whom Carol has often watched at play and wished that she could join them. Mrs. Ruggles, their widowed mother, toils ceaselessly to bring up this healthy brood of hers, from Sarah Maude, the elder, and the little mother, down to sturdy little Larry, the pet and pride of the Ruggles' family. Shortly before Christmas, Carol, who had been planning for some time to give a pleasant surprise to her Ruggles friends, asks her mother if she can invite them to a Christmas dinner. Mrs. Bird gladly consents, and so the letter of invitation is written by Carol and is carried to Mrs. Ruggles by Sarah Maude. The commotion which this letter creates is best told in the pictures, as are also the preparations made by Mrs. Ruggles to have her children appear in presentable condition. The mirth which these preparations create seizes the spectator with such continuous grip that he loses the sense of time and place. He is truly in the midst of it all, at times earnestly sympathizing with Mrs. Ruggles in the knotty problems that confront her and sincerely admiring the resourcefulness that overcomes every difficulty. Peory, for instance, has no stockings, and Mrs. Ruggles surmounts the difficulty by telling Clem, her eldest boy, to go out and ask Mrs. Cullen, a neighbor, to lend her a pair and to promise that Peory will give her boy Jim Cullen half of her candy. Peory flares up at this bargain, but Mrs. Ruggles settles the matter by asking: ""Which would you rather do. Give Jim half your candy or go to the party barelegged?"" The said stockings arc a sight, striped, not like a zebra, but black and white! ""Thay'll be the makin' of you! Ain't they stylish, Peory?"" Mrs. Ruggles says to that disgruntled young lady, as she surveys them with delight. Then in an aside to the other gazing members of the family, Mrs. Ruggles says confidently, ""Nobody'll fergit she's got 'em on."" This is only a single sample of the mirthful preparations, not omitting the dress rehearsal to which Mrs. Ruggles subjects her brood, before they depart for the Bird mansion. They are certain to delight both old and young, and people of all ages. The scene showing the Ruggles' family around the Christmas table, with Uncle Jack seated at the head and the invalid Carol looking delightedly on, will remain with everyone who sees it for some time to come. The director has seen to it that the Ruggles children eat just as they have been accustomed to eat at home, and Larry eats so ravenously that his face soon begins to pucker up with pain, which comes from an over-gorged ""tummie."" The closing scene is one of sadness. The merry Ruggles children have gone, laden with beautiful Christmas presents, taken from Carol's Christmas tree. In her mother's arms, the child is seized by a great faintness. ""Mother, I do think we have kept Christ's birthday this time just as He wanted it done,"" she whispers, and then passes away."

14301," In 1515 Machiavelli stated that it would be better for the Prince to be feared, than loved. Some 500 years later, Michael Hardt, political philosopher and co-author of Empire, Multitude and Commonwealth, asks what it would mean to base a political system on love, rather than on fear. How can we transform a society that is increasingly defined by a permanent state of war and cultivated by an industry of fear? How can we realize the paradigm shift necessary to move away from a reality that depends on the exploitation of people and the cult of privatizing public resources? Hardt looks for an answer in what he calls 'the commons', by which he refers not only to natural resources, but also to the languages we create- and the relationships we conceive together. In the dystopian city-state Alphaville, of Godard's eponymous film, all words and concepts relating to the idea of love and affection have been banned. When actress Anna Karina tries to express her feelings, she has to reinvent the words, for the concept of love is foreign to her. Like the protagonist in Alphaville, Hardt suggests that we need to redefine the tools to act politically together. Hardt embarks on a journey to identify the transformative powers of the ongoing struggle to re-invent democracy. Within this struggle he understands 'the commons' as an antidote against a society run by fear; an inspiration for a paradigm that is based on dialogue and cooperation."

The Dreams of Sparrows is dedicated to Saad Fahker, Associate Producer who died during the production. In the first act we meet Hayder Jabbar, one of the several Iraqi directors chosen by Daffar to contribute to the documentary portrait. After explaining his involvement in the project, Jabbar insists on thanking his savior George Bush, who he loves. Jabbar's convictions at the beginning of the film, contrasted with the bleak and often painful subjects of interview, introduce the essential divide within Iraqi psychology that the movie follows as it develops from the aftermath of war, the capture of Saddam and the realization of occupation.

11275," Tartessos is one of the most interesting cultures of Ancient times as well as a landmark in the History of Andalusia and the Mediterranean Sea. The mysterious atmosphere that surrounds Tartessos is due to German historian Adolf Schulten. Influenced by Schliemann's success in finding Troy, and his own findings in the Spanish city of Numantia, Schulten set up a myth around Tartessos and some of the ideas still persisting in Spanish nationality. He imagined an ideal civilization in the Andalusian Atlantic coastline, between East and West, the first city-state inhabited by peaceful, long-living people, with great culture, and ability for navigation, a set up mixing the Greek Atlantida and the American Eldorado. Apart from researching Schulten's life and work, this documentary contrasts that myth of Tartessos with the present knowledge, and proposes a reflection on the use of Archaeology and History during the 20th century to built national identities in Europe. The search for a mythical civilization in the south of the Peninsula, leads German historian Adolf Schulten to embark on an archeological adventure in Spain in the 1920's. Obsessed with the idea of becoming the discoverer of Tartessos, Schulten is to confront scientists, academics, aristocrats and even a rival of his stature; the Anglo-French archeologist George Bonsor, who had spent years doing research work on Andalusian antiquity. And he will occasionally rely on dubious methods to back his daring and obsession to locate ancient Tartessos in the Do艅ana Nature Reserve. In spite of his intuition and organizing skills, fortune does not smile on Schulten, who continues to publish his theses, against all evidence, his work being rejected by the scientific community because of the dubious scientism of his methods -and his exorbitant eagerness to upstage others. Only the discovery of the Carambolo Treasure shortly before his death confirmed the existence of an ancient kingdom in the remote past; a rich, cultured, seafaring people who were a focus of civilization 3000 years ago. Nowadays, science has managed to disassociate itself from Schulten's theories and proposes a new vision and approach to the Tartessian quest, within a historical and archeological context, which is still undergoing constant research at present, even on the spot. Nevertheless, that pioneering German succeeded in linking his name forever to that of Tartessos."

Throughout his 2008 Presidential campaign and term in office, questions have been raised regarding Barack Obama's family background, economic philosophy, and fundamental political ideology. Dreams from My Real Father is the alternative Barack Obama ""autobiography,"" offering a divergent theory of what may have shaped our 44th President's life and politics. In Dreams from My Real Father, Barack Obama is portrayed by a voiceover actor who chronicles Barack Obama's life journey in socialism, from birth through his election to the Presidency. The film begins by presenting the case that Barack Obama's real father was Frank Marshall Davis, a Communist Party USA propagandist who likely shaped Obama's world view during his formative years. Barack Obama sold himself to America as the multi-cultural ideal, a man who stood above politics. Was the goat herding Kenyan father only a fairly tale to obscure a Marxist agenda, irreconcilable with American values? This fascinating narrative is based in part on 2 years of research, interviews, newly unearthed footage and photos, and the writings of Davis and Obama himself. Dreams of My Real Father weaves together the proven facts with reasoned logic in an attempt to fill-in the obvious gaps in Obama's history. Is this the story Barack Obama should have told, revealing his true agenda for ""fundamentally transforming America?"" Director Joel Gilbert concludes, ""To understand Obama's plans for America, the question is not 'Where's the Birth Certificate?,' the question is 'Who is the real father?'"""

14225," The work and times of American artist, Leon Golubfrom 1985 to his death in 2004, taking us from images of interrogations and torture to the ironies and dark humor of old-age. Over-sized canvasses with screaming mercenaries and rioters urinating on a corpse; photographic fragments used as information and inspiration; the making of one of Golub's death-squad series from start to finish and to its exhibition in Derry, Northern Ireland; news footage from around the world; museum-goers' responses; disturbing music: out of these disparate elements the film creates a dialogue between image and audience that reflects what Golub calls the ""disjunctiveness"" of modern life. In the aftermath of September 11, and with the photos from Abu Ghraib prison scandal, Golub's ferocious, monumental work of the 70's and 80's (used to this day by human rights groups such as Amnesty International) remain prophetic and essential, even as they give way to the snarling dogs, erotica, and wise-cracking meditations on mortality which began to appear in his paintings in the 1990's. When we revisit Golub in 2001, the aging artist tells us ""my work these days is sort of political, sort of metaphysical, and sort of smart-ass. I'm playful and hostile. Let's see if you can keep up with my slipping around."" Half empty canvasses are dotted with birds of prey, smoking skulls, neon chorus girls, pierced hearts, and snickering text: ""Bite your tongue. Save your ass."" The film captures an historic artistic journey, shared with his wife and studio partner of 50 years, the prominent anti-war and feminist artist, Nancy Spero. We see them as each other's most valued critic and most ardent supporter. Golub continued in his later paintings to ""report"" on what's going on in the world, but he does it with the kind of dissonances and discontinuities that led Theodor Adorno in his essay on Beethoven to proclaim, ""In the history of art, late works are the catastrophes."""

Reports say the mayor told the police chief to make them disappear. In the course of this human erasure, three bystanders were killed, along with two of the students. Another student was found with his face torn off, obliterated, a warning: he was no one, you are no one too; we control everything; you control nothing, including your own fate. The bodies of the rest have not been found, though at one point some possible murderers said they were murdered the night they were kidnapped, then incinerated. Mexico went into a black state, everywhere students and all the youth were placing their profile picture in Facebook pitch black, in mourning in despair in frustration of not being seen or heard. The artist, Ana Teresa Fernandez, is painting herself black with a broad brush, the kind you'd paint walls with, not canvases: she's blotting herself out, an obliteration to protest an obliteration. Her work is against erasure, annihilation, is for asserting the existence of, the power of, the voice of, the rights of those who are trampled, erased, obliterated, women, immigrants, the poor, the brown, the black, the dark. It's an art of confrontation as well as liberation. And maybe the two are inseparable."

Now... consider the fact that 1/3rd of all women and girls worldwide are assaulted during their lifetime. That means one of every three females you know personally most likely has been attacked, and chances are they didn't fight back. Why is this, when females of other species would? ""Beauty Bites Beast"" sets out to answer this question and vanquish the barriers to teaching women and girls unarmed verbal and physical empowerment self-defense, while focusing on some of the surprising benefits: confidence, leadership, and self-esteem.

14384," He looks the part, both of a musician and an insane man; being lean and lanky, with the requisite of long hair and prominent features. First of all he intrudes upon the serene study of a fair maiden at the piano; finds fault with her rendition and makes her resign the ivories to his mercy, which he pounds frantically.

After World War II, four million black people created a dynamic urban culture outside the South, changing America forever. The sixty-minute documentary film traces this history through the personal stories of a group of older Chicagoans born mostly in the Mississippi Delta.

14127," The film ""Breaking Up The Signals"" revolves around four phone conversations, interwoven yet separated from one another. The meshing of four different settings, four characters roughly described and highly stereotypical through their use of the telephone, supposes a dialogue between the actors as a visual paradigm, an unconditional cinematic reality. If these stories are truly connected to one another, it is only because of certain common aesthetic features, from art direction, props, colors, to wording, oral and wandering facial expressions. Also, the notion of break up shifts from the human facet of an idiomatic expression to the technological meltdown leading to one's misunderstanding. Incidentally, if there is a theme that firmly holds this film together, it has to be the themes of miscommunication and miscomprehension, themes that try to be echoed throughout four different sets of parameters, four different sets of discourses."

15348," Twist of fate and the twists of mind of the characters (mostly couples) combine in just the right twinkled absurd way in the interweaving episodes of this comedy. Each of the characters gets a good shot at being sarcastic and each is a sorry loser at some point yet none is turned into the butt of the joke.

14773," The story of the largest surrender of American troops in our history goes largely untold. On the 60th Anniversary of their surrender to the Japanese and the subsequent March, a memorial sculpture was erected in Las Cruces, NM commemorating the sacrifice and toil of these men, among the greatest of American soldiers. ""The Making of a Memory"" follows the stories of those who participated in the event, as well as those who have worked hard to preserve it's history and honor it's soldiers, both in memory and in the artistry of the memorial sculpture ""Heroes of Bataan"". The film focuses on the efforts of both the survivors and those creating the Bataan Death March Memorial to pass on the story of the Bataan Death March. The film follows the making of the sculpture and the impact it has on the survivors. By letting the survivors themselves recount the events of the March, this film preserves first-person accounts of the unimaginable conditions these men experienced. Through the creation of the sculpture meant to honor them, and the transformation of this memorial from an idea to a reality, this film weaves a tapestry of the lives of all involved. We'll travel from the foundry in Berkeley where the sculpture is born into it's full size and scale, to the homes of survivors in Los Angeles, El Paso and the towns of New Mexico. Most crucial is the effort to tell the story that so many grand children and great-grandchildren of survivors do not know."

13807," Sobering tale about the small-time loser Santiago, who roams the streets of a Spanish town after leaving his wife and children looking for ground under his feet. There only seems to be one way out for him. Surprising, Dardennesque debut by producer Serrano. Somewhere in a Spanish city, Santiago (in his 30s and played by the Mexican painter Bosco Sodi) roams aimlessly and lonely through the streets. His wife has thrown him out and the judge has decided that he cannot see his children for now. Santiago tries to put his life back together again from this unfortunate situation. He has a job in a friend's bar, but is given the sack. Little by little, his life falls apart. The camera (impressive work by David Valdeperez) follows him roaming the streets looking for work and for an aim in life. His only way out seems to be the highest bridge in the city... Scriptwriter and novice director Carlos Serrano Azcona (1969) previously worked on ""Japon"" by Carlos Reygadas, who is co-producer this time, as is the Spaniard Jaime Rosales, director of e.g. ""Bullet in the Head"". The form and style of ""The Tree"" were partly inspired by the work of the Dardenne Brothers, but Serrano Azcona was also influenced by the possibilities of modern video cameras, as previously revealed by Albert Serra (""Honour of the Knights"") and Rafa Cortes (""Yo""). The result is a dynamic yet restrained and contemplative film. The Tree opens the eyes of the viewer to everyday despair and existential hope, culminating in a climax that has to be seen to be 'believed'. (ID/GT)"

12605," Beyond any face cream, cosmetic surgery or antioxidant pill, an extraordinary secret of renewal lies in the discovery of Australian scientist, Professor Elizabeth Blackburn. She has won the Gruber Prize and the Lasker Prize, two of the top international awards in medical research, and in 2009 has been awarded Nobel Prize for Medicine. Liz Blackburn discovered that as our cells divide and grow, a telomere - a small DNA cap at the end of each chromosome - protects our precious DNA from damage. She showed that an enzyme, called telomerase, repairs the telomeres and 'keeps DNA young'. Her breakthroughs have revolutionized our understanding of the aging process. Several new telomerase-based drugs have entered Phase II and III clinical trials. And there is a very real race for the ultimate anti-aging pill. Liz also masterminded new insights into stress and cancer. Current research reveals stressed people have shorter telomeres. Shorter telomers appear to predispose us to disease and cancer, and lead to shorter lives. Yet astonishingly, Liz discovered meditation appears to stall the process. Ironically, cancer is the true immortal. It has the ability to replicate effectively, endlessly. And cancer cells are overly rich in telomerase. Is the key to cancer's deadly success the clue to endless life? Aging, stress and cancer: three of the greatest fears of our times. All interconnected, and profoundly linked to the discovery of one remarkable Australian woman."

12311," Frank Galvin was once a promising Boston lawyer with a bright future ahead. An incident early in his career in which he was trying to do the right thing led to him being fired from the prestigious law firm with which he was working, almost being disbarred, and his wife leaving him. Continually drowning his sorrows in booze, he is now an ambulance chasing lawyer, preying on the weak and vulnerable, and bending the truth whenever necessary to make what few dollars he has, as he has only had a few cases in the last few years, losing the last four. His only friend in the profession is his now retired ex-partner, Mickey Morrissey, who gets Frank a case, his fee solely a percentage of what his clients are awarded. The case should net Frank tens of thousands of dollars by settling out of court, that money which would at least get him back on his feet. It is a negligence suit brought on behalf of Deborah Ann Kaye by her sister and brother-in-law, Sally and Kevin Doneghy, against St. Catherine Labour茅 Hospital, operated by the Archdiocese of Boston, and Drs. Towler and Marks. Kaye was admitted to the hospital for what should have been a routine delivery, but something that happened while Kaye was on the operating room table led to her brain being deprived of oxygen, resulting in permanent brain damage, and Kaye now being in a totally vegetative state requiring hospitalization for the rest of her life. Frank eventually learns that the cause seems to be that Dr. Towler, the anesthesiologist and an expert in the field, used the incorrect anesthetic for the situation. However, all but one person that was in the operating room that day has provided depositions that nothing improper occurred in the operating room. The one holdout is the operating room head nurse, Maureen Rooney, who is not talking, period, to Frank or the other side. Upon seeing the state Kaye is in, Frank unilaterally decides to do what he believes is the right thing by declining the lucrative out of court settlement offered by the Archdiocese and take the case to court. In doing so, he hopes the truth that the hospital and the doctors truly were negligent comes to light. Feeling that this case may be a turning point in his life, Frank has a new spring in his step, enough that he attracts the attention of Laura Fischer, the two who begin a relationship. Despite having whatever the truth is on his side, that truth which he does not know, and having an expert witness of his own, Frank has an uphill battle in that the Archdiocese has retained the services of Ed Concannon, a high priced lawyer who has a large team of associates whose task is to help Concannon and the Archdiocese win at any cost. Concannon's task seems even easier as Judge Hoyle, the presiding judge, is already biased against Frank for taking the case to court. Frank Galvin is a down-on-his luck lawyer, reduced to drinking and ambulance chasing. Former associate Mickey Morrissey reminds him of his obligations in a medical malpractice suit that he himself served to Galvin on a silver platter: all parties willing to settle out of court. Blundering his way through the preliminaries, he suddenly realizes that perhaps after all the case should go to court: to punish the guilty, to get a decent settlement for his clients, and to restore his standing as a lawyer."

14184," Louis Winthorpe is a businessman who works for commodities brokerage firm of Duke and Duke owned by the brothers Mortimer and Randolph Duke. Now they bicker over the most trivial of matters and what they are bickering about is whether it's a person's environment or heredity that determines how well they will do in life. When Winthorpe bumps into Billy Ray Valentine, a street hustler and assumes he is trying to rob him, he has him arrested. Upon seeing how different the two men are, the brothers decide to make a wager as to what would happen if Winthorpe loses his job, his home and is shunned by everyone he knows and if Valentine was given Winthorpe's job. So they proceed to have Winthorpe arrested and to be placed in a compromising position in front of his girlfriend. So all he has to rely on is the hooker who was hired to ruin him. Philadelphia based Louis Winthorpe III was born into and has solely lived a life of privilege. He is Harvard educated, is successful at his job, has a lavish home paid for by his employers, and is wealthy. The children he will probably have with his fianc茅e Penelope will most likely also know nothing but privilege. But he and his friends, who all have similar backgrounds, are pompous and snobbish. His job is as managing director at Duke & Duke, a commodities brokerage house owned by brothers Randolph and Mortimer Duke. The Duke brothers often disagree with each other and make wagers on the outcome of these disagreements. Their latest wager is about ""nature versus nurture"": the importance environment plays versus one's natural bloodline in determining how one's life will turn out. The guinea pigs in their experiment are Winthorpe, whose life they will attempt to ruin to see how he reacts, and Billy Ray Valentine, a black hustler/crook who the Dukes and Winthorpe encountered in one of his scams. Like Winthorpe, Valentine was born into and has lived the only life he has ever known. They will attempt to place Valentine into every aspect of Winthorpe's life to see how he functions. Without either knowing of anyone else involved, Coleman, Winthorpe's manservant who is officially employed by the Dukes in his day-to-day job, and a streetwise hooker named Ophelia each play a role in the Duke's plan. Also deeply involved in their plan is a private detective the Dukes often use, Clarence Beeks. Beyond the outcome of the Dukes' experiment, can either Winthorpe or Valentine change the course of the new life set out for them by the Dukes, even if they knew what the Dukes were doing? Regardless, this experience will fundamentally change the lives of both Winthorpe and Valentine, but not at without the expense of others as well. Mortimer and Randolph Duke are commodity brokers who enjoy a little wager now and then. For the latest bet, Randolph believes they can take a common criminal and make him a successful businessman in the company. The criminal, Billy Ray, is to be given the job and home of Louis, who in turn is set up for crimes he didn't commit, to see if he resorts to crime once he's lost his rich environment and friends. Louis Winthorpe III is a successful Philadelphia commodity broker with mansion, manservant and girlfriend to match. Billy Ray Valentine is a hustling beggar. Winthorpe's employers, the elderly Duke brothers, make a bet that by switching the lifestyle of the two Billy Ray will make good and their man will take to a life of crime. Suddenly Louis finds himself uncomprehendingly with no job, no home and only a new acquaintance, glamorous hooker Ophelia, prepared to help him. So at least in one way things could actually be worse."

10120," This film is a visual poem; A melange of images that serves as an ode to parents that attempts to capture the feelings of the meaning they can hold for us, while we grapple with the living knowledge of future loss. It is about coming to terms with who they are and their impact on the artist as individual. ----- About the Kobresia film series: Sometimes a word can take on a new meaning, a personal meaning that transcends simplistic definition; something organic and not always easy to put into words. Kobresia is a genus of plants in the sedge family. Kobresia is also a music track by the Norwegian ambient electronic musician Geir Jenssen, aka Biosphere. The song has had great impact on me and my approach to the work. For me, ""kobresia"" has come to represent something layered, organic, sometimes nuanced, subtle, sometimes obvious, but always something bound by the notion that the whole of a story is synergistic, more than the sum of it's parts. Sometimes it is about a feeling or notion in it's pure state, but not necessary something tidy. These films are experiments in abstract, non-linear narrative and personal imagistic storytelling."

14837," A famine with multiple contributing factors and devastating effects during the Second Sino-Japanese war is chronicled from the official perspective of reporters, generals, politicians and real families whose lives were forever altered by drastic measures they were forced to take in order to survive. Alternately ignoring the dire nature of the famine and its subsequent exodus of millions of people from the Hunen province, and minimizing its devastation to the outside world, the Chinese Nationalist government of the time is one which seems to be over burdened by ongoing war efforts and corruption in the distribution of relief supplies. Policy and private life are worlds apart in stopping the devastation shown through the portrayals of those who lived to tell the tale and their accounts of those who were not so lucky, of whom there were many (3 million.) This is a true story based upon Liu Zhenyun's novel ""Remembering 1942,"" Zhenyun himself is the descendant of a survivor of the 1942 famine and his family story is poignantly portrayed--showing heroism, self sacrifice, terrible misfortune and ultimate survival of the lucky few."

Norf, one of the planet's most influential inhabitants, makes sure he is the shiniest and brightest individual. One day as he is showing of his new shiny fro, the gray clouds hinder the sun from making him radiant. Despite Brolli's warnings, the enraged Norf sends the clouds away from the planet.

You're mocked and you struggle daily to maintain your surroundings and health.

Most are still overwhelmed with debilitating symptoms years after exposure, while doctors, lawmakers, and attorneys take sides and dismiss their claims. Black Mold Exposure follows Michael Roland Williams, filmmaker, and Karen Noseff, founder and designer of Fortune Denim, struggling to regain their livelihood and well-being after they were unknowingly exposed to high levels of various molds that had infested Karen's apartment. The entire 264-unit apartment community was evacuated and closed indefinitely. Michael and Karen claim to have developed allergies and sensitivities to virtually everything, causing them difficulty in finding ""safe"" housing as well as numerous other bizarre problems that have continued over the last five years. A growing number of people from all ages and walks of life claim mold made them ill while physicians, lawmakers, and medical associations dispute the validity of these claims. Most of the symptoms of those claiming illness from mold can be caused by, and diagnosed as, any number of other illnesses. There are no standardized methods to measure what molds, at what exposure levels, over what period of time, might cause any given person to become ill. BLACK MOLD EXPOSURE explores the bizarre illnesses associated with exposure to toxic mold and the film participants' difficult task of regaining their health and lives in an atmosphere of political and social intolerance and disbelief.

13071," Narrated by Donald Sutherland. For hundreds of years the public has only seen the surface of famous masterpieces by artists such as Van Gogh and Rembrandt. Now, through a melding of innovative scientific techniques and art connoisseurship, completely different paintings and important clues about the artists themselves are being uncovered one layer at a time. For hundreds of years the public has only seen the surface of famous masterpieces by artists such as Van Gogh and Rembrandt. Now, through a melding of innovative scientific techniques and art connoisseurship, completely different paintings and important clues about the artists themselves are being uncovered one layer at a time. Using non-invasive technology such as x-ray fluorescence and 3D imaging can reveal these ""worlds within a world"" of art. Researchers can calculate how and when an artist first began working on their composition by tracing fingerprints, brushstrokes and analyzing different layers of paint pigments. These elements, once fully uncovered, sometimes reveal completely different works of art underneath the surface that were abandoned by these great artists and painted over. To help answer the question of why their works were abandoned, Out of the Shadows focuses on a group of scholars, particularly The Rembrandt Research Project in Holland, who have only recently digitally restored these lost images. The group's attention is drawn to two paintings that were once dismissed as being mere copies of Rembrandt and have recently been attributed as authentic. Out of the Shadows explores just how closely science allows art historians to enter an artist's psyche. The question of why an artist would choose to paint over their own masterpiece is explored in this fascinating documentary that ultimately rewrites the foundations of art history. For hundreds of years the public has only seen the surface of famous masterpieces by artists such as Van Gogh and Rembrandt. Now, completely different paintings and important clues about the artists themselves are being uncovered one layer at a time."

14979," A look at man's relationship with Dirt. Dirt and humans couldn't be closer. We started our journey together as stardust, swirled by cosmic forces into our galaxy, solar system, and planet. We are made of the same stuff. Four billion years of evolution created dirt as the living source of all life on Earth including humans. Dirt has given us food, shelter, fuel, medicine, ceramics, flowers, cosmetics and color --everything needed for our survival. For most of the last ten thousand years we humans understood our intimate bond with dirt and the rest of nature. We took care of the soils that took care of us. But, over time, we lost that connection. Our species became greedy and careless. We still depend on dirt, but now we abuse and ignore it. We are destroying our last natural resource with our agriculture, our mining, and our paving over the planet for cities. We turned dirt into something ""dirty."" In doing so, we transform the skin of the earth into a hellish and dangerous landscape for all life on earth. A millennial shift in consciousness about the environment offers a beacon of hope - and practical solutions. Around the globe, pioneers are coming together to save earth's last natural resource. Tiny villages rise up to battle giant corporations slaughtering their land. Scientists discover connections with soil that can balance global warming. Generation X brands organic farming as trendy and children begin to eat from edible school yards. Inmates find inner peace and job skills in a prison horticulture program. Medical researchers explore dirt's capacity to provide solutions to such devastating health crises as AIDS. Major religions are rediscovering the reverence for the natural world that unites them all. Uses animation, vignettes, personal accounts and story telling. ""Floods, drought, climate change, even war are all directly related to the way we are treating dirt."" DIRT! The Movie-directed and produced by Bill Benenson and Gene Rosow-takes you inside the wonders of the soil. It tells the story of Earth's most valuable and under appreciated source of fertility-from its miraculous beginning to its crippling degradation. The opening scenes of the film dive into the wonderment of the soil. Made from the same elements as the stars, plants and animals, and us, ""dirt is very much alive."" Though, in modern industrial pursuits and clamor for both profit and natural resources, our human connection to and respect for soil has been disrupted. ""Drought, climate change, even war are all directly related to the way we are treating dirt."" DIRT! The Movie-narrated by Jaime Lee Curtis-brings to life the environmental, economic, social and political impact that the soil has. It shares the stories of experts from all over the world who study and are able to harness the beauty and power of a respectful and mutually beneficial relationship with soil. DIRT! The Movie is simply a movie about dirt. The real change lies in our notion of what dirt is. The movie teaches us: ""When humans arrived 2 million years ago, everything changed for dirt. And from that moment on, the fate of dirt and humans has been intimately linked."" But more than the film and the lessons that it teaches, DIRT! The Movie is a call to action. ""The only remedy for disconnecting people from the natural world is connecting them to it again."" What we've destroyed, we can heal. Dirt, which is unique to Earth of any of the known planets and which acts as the planet's ""skin"", is made up of the same elements as humans, and is a living, breathing, complex and essential building block for human survival. The relationship between dirt, which covers approximately the top five centimeters of the Earth's surface, and humans is presented. Left to its own devices, the planet is able to regenerate dirt if all the necessary elements are available, such as a diversity in organic matter, microorganisms and water. The planet's forests are a prime example, forest floors which have generally the richest dirt on the planet. But humans have largely altered the natural landscape to affect negatively the planet's ability to maintain the existing dirt and regenerate it as a healthy entity. It is based on what humans generally consider more valuable uses of the land, whether it be for development i.e. covering the dirt with impermeable materials such as asphalt and concrete, resource extraction or something else. Even in the industrial age, mono-cultural farming practices of annual crops, i.e. miles upon miles of only one crop of an annual plant being grown, are depleting the health of dirt, with the answer being often to cut down more forests to create more farmland. As such, humans need to place a higher value on ecological sustainability, most specifically in dirt health, or else risk the species at our own hands."

13025," Excerpt from Andrej Solzhkins' travel notebooks (IV: 129a): ""One can never forget the buzz of this city. It almost feels natural, it feels as if it was with you even while you were away from Athens, as if you have been carrying it all along over the lands you have been wandering on. Now it's around you again, eternal and subtle, more than a sound - a whole sensual experience. Angry cars hurrying to nowhere, the metro driving blindly under the ground, fridges struggling to maintain goods, car alarms waiting to go on, televisions on mute and computers on stand-by - all machines and their dreams, the baseline of history. The city itself will compose its melodies upon this baseline: sometimes reproductions of pop riffs sometimes free jazz improvisations; she will even perform silence upon this baseline - the melodies might temporarily cease, but the bass never stops. People synchronize their heartbeat with it and thus do I. Marble ruins and shiny metal vehicles, the city breaths out haze; glorious and insignificant at the same time, the past; conceptions of linear history collapse under the weight of the ever-present past. Sisyphian errands and dreams of the sea - everybody dreams of the sea, gentle souls in tense bodies walking on the burning pavement; sweat. Affirming motion, concluding effort, sweat appears in rorschach formations on the back of their t-shirts, revealing the schizophrenia of the city. Everybody wants to be somewhere else, somewhere south."""

I know it's not easy living with a mental illness but I strongly believe in today's recovery movement where you make positive choices in your life and stick to them. I sincerely hope that this message touches you in one way or another. Thank you for your support and know matter what ''never give up.'"

By day, Marshall -- a reluctant construction worker -- lays ceramic tiles in the kitchens and bathrooms of the citizens of Windsor, Ontario. But, by night, he escapes the monotony of his blue-collar life by making movies. His last project, Xeno's Inferno, which he made with his eccentric brother - and partner in crime -- Christian, features a cast of Windsor's finest exotic dancers and barflies. Part Ed Wood, part Russ Meyer, Marshall is a filmmaker whose projects reflect his rather unique way of seeing the world. When it comes to making films, Marshall does everything himself: he raises the money, casts his friends and family, and shoots and edits on the cheap and dirty. This guy is resourceful and driven like no one else. And now he's poised to take on his greatest challenge yet: making his first ""legitimate"" film. Marshall has decided to produce, direct and star in a no-budget, dramatic feature about the rise and fall of his family's fast-food empire - a chain of hamburger joints known affectionately throughout the Windsor area as the Hi Ho Restaurants. In making his film on the Hi Ho Empire, Marshall hopes to right the wrongs of history by exposing the fact that his late grandfather, Amie Fortin, is the true inventor of fast food. Marshall's plan involves wading through the often-conflicting anecdotes offered by his grandfather's living sons: Francis, Donat, Paul, and Norman. Together, Marshall refers to them as ""the four gospels"". But the plan goes sour as Marshall's uncles start to worry about Marshall's emphasis on the dark decline of the family empire. As it turns out, they're not so crazy about their dogged nephew dragging out the skeletons from the family closet. One by one they begin to stonewall the project - a project that teeters ever closer to the brink of disaster. As his film slowly derails, the only thing keeping Marshall from a total nervous collapse is his daily visits with his elderly grandmother - a retired hairstylist and housebound hypochondriac. Through seasonal haircuts and endless games of cards they manage to forge a powerful bond that is at once bizarre and thoroughly touching. As Marshall's childhood friend, documentary filmmaker Matt Gallagher follows Marshall's personal odyssey - from its ambitious beginnings to its unraveling conclusion. Soon, a film within a film emerges and the line between truth and fiction becomes increasingly blurred. Along the way, The Rise and Fall of the Grumpy Burger delves into the madness of amateur filmmaking, the complexities of family ties, and the ""truth"" about fast food."

These universal truths come into being spontaneously and exist perpetually and eternally because they cannot be destroyed.

15237," For men, it's something they get: 'I got some tail, I got some action.' -- for women, the first time is explained in terms of loss: 'I lost my virginity, I lost my innocence;' documentary filmmakers Heather Maclean and Heidi Sackerson investigate the losers, the women. Documentary filmmakers Heather Maclean and Heidi Sackerson set out to investigate the one event so memorable that no woman can ever erase it from her mind - their first time. It is said that every woman remembers her first time, what is not said is how much it defines their view of sex and the opposite sex. After shooting over thirty women in the studio, the filmmakers invited the women back to tell their stories in the location of the virginity loss. The stories didn't change but the emotions clearly did. What we found striking about the stories is how similar they are independent of race, age and culture; it never ceased to amaze us how women of very differing backgrounds seem to live out the same tale. It's just the surroundings that change: the closet, the motel 6, the Econoline van, and yes even the bedroom. These stories do more than educate and entertain, they make us relive the moment that none of us are truly prepared for."

10862," The media's portrayal of Guadeloupe is alarming and seems to be summed up in few words: delinquency, violence, unemployment, prostitution, and addiction.

It follows the raw story of a man who overcame a life of drugs and violence to become a rebel of hope, waging a 13 year war to free enslaved children. Sam Childers grew up in the hills of Pennsylvania. His parents were decent folk, but at an early age, Sam started to show a knack for getting into trouble. His father, a former marine, grew fond of saying, ""Boy, somebody's gonna kill you one of these days!"" By his early teens, he was constantly in trouble. Whether it was fights, drugs, or married women, Sam slid deeper into a life of violence and crime. He eventually became a 'Shotgunner' - an armed guard for drug dealers. It was during this stage of his life when he met Lynn, a stripper, who would later become his wife. Haunted by his father's words, he became increasingly concerned that he was going to be killed because of his lifestyle and began to distance himself from it. He found a job in construction and prospered, despite his continuing drug and alcohol habit. Lynn, meanwhile, returned to the Church she had forsaken as a young adult. Sam also sought to re-establish his relationship with God and began to live a clean life. Lynn gave birth to a healthy baby girl and Sam started his own construction business. Little did they know that their greatest challenge was just around the corner. In 1998, urged by his Pastor in America, Sam arrived in war-torn Southern Sudan with a mission group to help repair huts damaged in the conflict. One afternoon, he stumbled across the body of a child, torn apart by a landmine. He fell to his knees and made a pledge to God to do whatever it took to help the people of Southern Sudan. God sent him a message back: Build an orphanage for the children, and build it here. The local people thought he was mad. At the time, the Lord's Resistance Army, a brutal rebel militia that had kidnapped scores of children and murdered hundreds of thousands of villagers, was laying waste to the area. Sam was adamant and held fast to God's mandate. He would build the orphanage there! Slowly the orphanage began to take shape. During the day Sam cleared brush and built the huts that would house the children. During the night, he slept under a mosquito net, with a bible in one hand and an AK-47 in the other. Sam began to lead armed missions to rescue children from the LRA. It wasn't long before tales of his exploits spread and villagers began to call him ""The Machine Gun Preacher."" Thirteen years later the orphanage is one of the largest in Southern Sudan and has fed and housed over 1,000 children. Today around 200 children call the orphanage home. Unfortunately, there are still many Sudanese children suffering and in need of rescue."

12672," America's Lost Landscape: The Tallgrass Prairie tells the rich and complex story of one of the most astonishing alterations of nature in human history. Prior to Euro-American settlement in the 1820s, one of the major landscape features of North America was 240 million acres of tallgrass prairie. But between 1830 and 1900 - in the space of a single lifetime - the tallgrass prairie was steadily transformed to farmland. This drastic change in the landscape also brought about an enormous social change for Native Americans; in an equally short time their cultural imprint was reduced in essence to a handful of place-names appearing on maps. America's Lost Landscape examines the record of human struggle, triumph, and defeat that prairie history exemplifies, including the history and culture of America's aboriginal inhabitants. The story of how and why the prairie was changed by Euro-American settlement is thoughtfully nuanced. The film also highlights prairie preservation efforts and explores how the tallgrass prairie ecosystem may serve as a model for a sustainable agriculture of the future. The extraordinary cinematography of prairie remnants, original score and archival images are all delicately interwoven to create a powerful and moving viewing experience about the natural and cultural history of America."

She discovers that in Britain, unlike in Japan, the global economy has not managed to bring down the price of new houses, and indeed the principal effect of the digital economy has been to create wealth which has raised the market price of the existing, dilapidated housing stock. In a supermarket, the kind of building to which the techniques of low-cost mass building have been successfully applied, she meets an old friend and they fall in love; they look for somewhere to settle down. Investigating the utopian architects Constant, Buckminster Fuller and the Archigram group she finds that their ideas have all failed to affect the housing economy, and that only 28% of house buyers in Britain would consider buying a new house, and that at the current rate of building, each house now standing in Britain will have to last for more than 5,000 years. At both the rich and poor ends of society, some have succeded in escaping dilapidated dwellings. Wealthy individual architects have put systemic building theories into practice: she visits the Eames house, built from factory-made parts. She sees the revival of interest in social housing and visits both Goldfinger's Trellick Tower and an estate in Byker. She is disappointed to discover that the architects of the millennium village at Greenwich have disowned the project once the developers have put it into practice. Finally, she reflects that it may never be possible to reconcile the needs of the dwelling place with the globalised economy."

14285," A lively geometric ballet, abstract fa莽ade architectures, or possibly Tetris the computer game gone berserk? The associations evoked by the video track 09 represent a paradigmatic cross-section of modern electronic culture. There is no torrential morphing of images, no unending sequence of special effects, nor chaotic fantasy animation. [n:ja]'s style of visual composition is characterized by a reductionistic method of dealing with abstract geometric parameters which produces a truly self-contained visual counterpart to the music's electronic crackling. In combination with the elegantly grooving schniebeln by shabotinski, a blueprint for a matrix of sounds and images results, and the inherent range of possible variations is fully exploited by means of recursive (digital) tricks. As in her previous videos perceptive faculty 2 and rewind, [n:ja] employs simple structural variations in track 09. A geometric grid of variable grayshade windows opens on a monochromatic orange surface. Rotation, zoom and then a dance of bars and pixels are used to create a diagonal and vertical ballet which increasingly seems to conform to some kind of order. The constantly modulating windows, independently organized so to speak, are brought into every conceivable position until an additional zoom leads to the ""refrain"" and a reflection of the entire matrix's structure is produced. The aesthetic of early computer games is juxtaposed with a futurism which concentrates on form; musical accompaniment of retro saxophone and theremin escorts an immersion into deobjectified futuristic fa莽ades.

10849," July 1987: Robert Panaud witnesses the closure of the blast furnace at the foot of which he spent his whole working life. This funeral service put an end to 120 years of History. After the ceremony, presided over by his son, a young engineer, he reminisces and tells him about his life as a steelworker. It started in 1945 when, at the age of 15, full of hope and confident in his future, he first went through the factory gates. It petered out forty years later with his taking early retirement after a somewhat checkered working life. Robert's story is everyman's. He shares with us his joys, his suffering, his loves and his disappointments. An ordinary steelworker who loves his job and is proud to do it. He is also proud to belong to the nobility of a dynasty of workers, of which he is the last representative. In numerous flashbacks, he tells us what he knows about the life of his father, his grandfather, and his forebears. All of them were steelworkers. Marcel Panaud (1902-1930). C茅lestin Panaud (1878-1924) who had such a tragic fate. Jules Panaud (1846-1885) his great grandfather who died in a penal colony. And a forefather, presumably called Auguste Panaud, whose track has now been lost. We discover that, over the course of time, the worker's words are a cry. The cry to make oneself heard over the racket of the workshop. The cry of rebellion. The cry of the workers' revolts from 1830 to the present. The cry of suffering. The cry of death. The cry his grandfather made when he fell into a tank of molten metal. With sadness tinged with anger, Robert looks at the steel ingot taken out of the tank and given to the family in memory of the deceased. That is when, in front of the fireplace where the piece of metal is in pride of place near a bouquet of artificial flowers, he realizes that his life only makes any sense to him if it is linked to the struggles made by those who went before him. The history of the metal industry is that of the blacksmiths and the metalworkers, that of Robert and his son Pierre, an engineer, the finest jewel in the family dynasty. It is History written over the course of a century by the men and women of 'the Europe of Coal and Steel': French, Germans, Belgians, people from Eastern Europe, Polish, Italian, and North African immigrants who come together in this film to make this four-part story a universal one."" The Cry is the final mini-series in a TV trilogy written by Herv茅 Basl茅. The first part, Between Land and Sea told the epic story of the fishermen of Newfoundland. The second, Le Champ Dolent described the unprecedented revolution that peasants underwent during the 20th century. Following the same principles of narration and spectacle, The Cry portrays the world of steelworkers. After water and earth, fire."

13073," Darby Clyde Fenster and Jerry Martin are a pair of penniless nincompoop-drifters who hop a freight and theyre on their way to Florida.

Their troubles only begin when they pass by a chicken farm and are overtaken by their pangs of hunger. The sneak into the hen house and haplessly attempt to nab some birds.

11138," Nick Broomfield met Hsiao Hung Pai, a journalist who was working for the Guardian, when making his feature film 'Ghosts' (about the Morecambe Bay Chinese Cockle Pickers ). As an experiment and using the latest in undercover technology, Nick worked with Hsiao to make a Undercover film set in a Chinese brothel in Finchley. There are over 2000 'illegal' brothels in London,largely ignored by the police and the authorities, which employ 80% foreign nationals, mostly illegal, that are easily exploited by the brothel owners. The film has a very different feel from the normal undercover film. This is due to the camera being mounted in the center of spectacles, which causes the participants to look directly into the camera, achieving a great intimacy and the possibility of making a character lead undercover film. This is also a very subjective story, told through the eyes of Hsiao Hung Pai, an immigrant herself, who though a very experienced undercover reporter went through great personal trauma revisiting this territory."

They terrorized the people in the country through killings, rapes, dismemberment and destruction. They were becoming more powerful as they closed in on the capital city, Monrovia.

The truly final mission for the women was to ensure a democratic election and elect a woman into the office of the presidency. The power of the women prevails. The first female president is elected. The women can finally go home. Mission accomplished. Peace reigns in Liberia."

12085," For generations, Patua (Chitrakar) communities of West Bengal, India have been painters and singers of stories depicted in scrolls. In the past they used to receive food or money for their recital of Muslim and Hindu stories and folk myths. Unfortunately, competition from other media significantly eroded this way of life. In response to this cultural crisis and as a way to make extra money, a group of women from Naya formed a scroll painters' collaborative.

Their stories attest to what it means to be a woman in Bengal and India today, demonstrating how a small group of determined women can empower themselves by adapting an ancient art to new conditions."

12344," Midterms follows four competitive congressional races in three swing states, each of which has the potential to switch parties. In North Carolina, three leading Republicans - NC House Speaker Thom Tillis, Tea Party-backed Greg Brannon and Pastor Mark Harris are battling in the Primary for the opportunity to take on Senator Kay Hagan (D). In Colorado, former CO House Speaker Andrew Romanoff (D) is vying to for the 6th District House of Representatives seat currently held by Republican Mike Coffman. In Iowa, two open seats are up for grabs after the retirements of Democratic US Senator Tom Harkin and Republican Congressman Tom Latham. We begin in Iowa, where three leading Republicans hope to win the primary: former energy executive Mark Jacobs, State Senator Joni Ernst and college professor/radio host Sam Clovis. Jacobs led the race early by spending millions of his own dollars, but Ernst begins to attract attention for her quirky advertisements: one boasts of castrating hogs and one shows her on a Harley and at a gun range. The race between the two becomes tight and nasty. Ernst gets a high profile endorsement from former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. Meanwhile, Sam Clovis visits a NW Iowa Dutch Tulip Festival and shares his conservative views with parade watchers. All three hope to face Democratic Congressman Bruce Braley, who warns voters that they will need to work hard to counter the attacks that will come in the general election. Also in Iowa, Democrat Staci Appel is trying to become the first woman to represent Iowa in Congress as she seeks to flip Tom Latham's 3rd District Congressional seat. She will face one of three Republicans: IA Secretary of State Matt Schultz, State Senator Brad Zaun or David Young, a former Chief of Staff for US Senator Chuck Grassley who does magic tricks during speeches. All the candidates practice the retail politics that Iowans have come to expect: making phone calls, going door-to-door, attending picnics and county fairs. Back in Colorado, Romanoff and Coffman attend parades, running back and forth between voters. The incumbent Coffman has had to moderate his positions as his district has become more diverse. The campaign is already getting ugly. One voter complains to Romanoff that she dislikes an ad that disparages Coffman. Romanoff says that the ad came from an outside group and that he'd fire anyone on his staff that disparaged his opponent. In North Carolina, Thom Tillis has the establishment GOP backing to lead the race to challenge 1st term Senator Hagan. Greg Brannon uses a last minute appeal from Senator Rand Paul to try to boost his chances, but Tillis' operation proves superior. On Primary night, Tillis wins easily and celebrates with his family in a hotel suite in Charlotte before heading to his victory party to address supporters. Returning to Iowa, it's Primary Day in the US House race. Candidates need to get to 35% to avoid a District Convention and it looks like Brad Zaun is the only candidate who might have enough supporter to clear that hurdle. Zaun comes up short however, while Matt Schultz gets 18% and David Young finishes 5th. All will head to convention. In the Senate race, however, Joni Ernst appears to have the momentum. She gets last minute endorsements from former MA Governor Mitt Romney and FL Senator Marco Rubio. On Primary night, she dominates the field, taking over half of the vote. Sam Clovis surprises by finishing 2nd, ahead of Mark Jacobs. Finally, it's the day of District Convention to select the Republican nominee in the Iowa 3rd House race. Matt Schultz is convinced that the nominee will be either him or Brad Zaun. Both, along with Young, make impassioned pleas to the delegates. On the third ballot, Schultz is eliminated, but Young is still in it. Schultz surprises Zaun - and the delegates - by endorsing Young. Finally, in a head-to-head match-up, Young comes out on top. Referencing his magic tricks, he vows to ""make Staci Appel disappear in November""."

15726," A picture is a lasting memory, and a memory that can forget is a picture that can be erased. ""Translucent Twilight"" seeks to highlight how privileged is our Argentine territory in natural resources, emphasizing its vast reserves of fresh water. Throughout photographs taken at the Nahuel Huapi National Park we try to capture a certain moment to turn it into memory, to make it last somehow.

Memory is the phenomenon of the presence of one thing which is absent; memory is the fight against oblivion. Here we arrive at the reflective mnemonic Ranci膷re's experience and his objetal approach, according to which all consciousness is consciousness of something, and oblivion is the destruction of footprints. The landscapes contain their past in the form of footprints, and contain its history as the lines of a hand. In this context, we must fight against oblivion and create a collective memory that contemplates the beauty and richness of our Patagonian territory and its natural resources."

13064," The year is 1984 and the mayoress has removed set personal criteria form the requirements to join the police force. No longer is sex, weight, height and orientation a factor. This now allows for an insurgence of people applying. The Police Academy series follows a select group of misfits in their quest to become police men and women. The first film of the series follows these misfits in their time at the Police Academy. The main focus is on a petty criminal called Mahoney. Mahoney is busted for criminal damage and as punishment is forced to go to Police Academy. Mahoney initially feels that this isn't the right place for him and he makes it his mission to be thrown out as he is not allowed to quit. As the classes go by and the training exercises are played out, Mahoney soon realizes that he is actually enjoying the academy and does want to become a police officer. We are also introduced to the gun maniac Tackelberry, the very tall Hightower, voluptuous Callahan, squeaky Hooks, human beat box and sound effects master Jones and the ever confuzzled Commandant Lassard. This group become good friends and become the base for the rest of the series of films. New rules enforced by the Lady Mayoress mean that sex, weight, height and intelligence need no longer be a factor for joining the Police Force. This opens the floodgates for all and sundry to enter the Police Academy, much to the chagrin of the instructors. Not everyone is there through choice, though. Social misfit Mahoney has been forced to sign up as the only alternative to a jail sentence and it doesn't take long before he falls foul of the boorish Lieutenant Harris. But before long, Mahoney realises that he is enjoying being a police cadet and decides he wants to stay... while Harris decides he wants Mahoney out! As a crime wave sweeps through a city that doesn't have enough police officers, the mayor decides that part of the problem may stem from overly restrictive qualifications for police officers, so she opens the door of the city's Police Academy to anyone who wants to join. Chief Henry Hurst does not agree with the mayor's decision. Soon, the academy is overrun with misfits, including parking lot attendant Carey Mahoney, who has been arrested before. Captain Reed, a longtime friend of Mahoney's father, gives Mahoney the choice of taking the 14 week course and joining the force, or going to jail. Mahoney chooses the academy. Karen Thompson is an attractive cadet whom Mahoney has his eyes on. Florist Moses Hightower is a mountain of a man who likes to tend flowers. And Larvell Jones has the ability to imitate the sound of virtually anything. Also in the academy are guy-magnet Debbie Callahan, squeaky voiced Laverne Hooks, gun loving Eugene Tackleberry, and Leslie Barbara (Donovan Scott), a cadet who has been picked on one too many times. Befuddled Commandant Eric Lassard and his lackey, Lieutenant Thaddeus Harris, are not exactly thrilled with the new recruits. As Lassard and Harris try to wash their hands of the recruits, Mahoney and his classmates become all the more determined to make good, even when one of the recruits accidentally starts a chain reaction of fights that lead to a riot in the city. The city is in need of more police officers, so the mayor decides to alter the requirements for acceptance into the Police Academy. Among the new cadets is Moses Hightower, a gentle giant who was a florist. Leslie Barbara, who is tired of being picked on. Laverne Hooks, a mousy, meek voice person. Karen Thompson, a socialite, who hopes that it'll allow her the opportunity to meet some unusual people. Eugene Tackleberry, a guy who likes to discharge his weapon. Larvell Jones, a human sound effects machine, who was met at the police station by Carey Mahoney, a guy who is basically a good guy but has a little trouble with authority figures, a retaliates by committing outrageous acts that get him arrested. He is fortunate that police Captain Reed is a good friend of his father and has been bailing him out but now Reed thinks that jail is what Mahoney needs but Mahoney disagrees. Reed suggest that Mahoney join the police academy but must complete the 14 week course or else he will be sent to jail. So Mahoney brings Jones with him hoping that he can help Mahoney get thrown out. It also seems that the police chief doesn't agree with the mayor so he instructs Commandant Lassard and Lieutenant Harris to encourage the bad apples to quit."

Hud's nephew Lon admires Hud's cheating ways, though he soon becomes aware of Hud's reckless amorality to bear him anymore. In the world of the takers and the taken, Hud is a winner. He's a cheat, but, he explains ""I always say the law was meant to be interpreted in a lenient manner."" Homer Bannon is an honest, hard-working, by-the-book Texas rancher. His son, Hud, is quite the opposite - amoral, unscrupulous and tending to prefer chasing married women around, rather than working on the ranch. The two are in constant conflict. Stuck between the two are Lonnie, Hud's nephew, and Alma, the Bannon's live-in housekeeper. Lonnie is a naive, impressionable young man who simultaneously idolises Hud and despises some of the things he does. Alma is constantly positive, is happy to overlook Hud's antagonism and tries to stay out of the fights. What happened to Lonnie's father, Hud's brother, hangs over the family, but nobody dares speak about it.

Jay has just been dumped by his fianc茅. With nothing else to anticipate at home but the next cocaine-induced high, Dunkin and Jay journey on a whim to exotic Colombia. In Colombia, Dunkin and Jay find a people and terrain more beautiful than they had imagined. They discover new friendships and loves.

15479," In ""Killer Whale and Crocodile"" carvers from two of the world's great carving traditions come together. A First Nations carver from Canada travels into the jungles of Papua New Guinea and a New Guinea carver travels to urban Canada. Together, they share each other's cultures and learn about the myths and legends that inform their individual artistic styles. In the Spring of 2006 John Marston, a young Coast Salish carver from Vancouver Island who has already gained a strong reputation for his innovative approach to traditional Coast Salish styles, visited Teddy Balangu, a carver from the Sepik River of Papua New Guinea. Teddy returned to Canada where he was the artist in residence at the Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia for 5 months. What strikes the eye as one looks from John's art to Teddy's is the similarity of forms and lines found in Coast Salish and Sepik River pieces. The Coast Salish carvings include killer whales, ravens and eagles; the Sepik pieces include crocodiles, cassowaries and hornbills. But both speak of culture, tradition and art. John and Teddy's journeys would not have been possible without Elaine Monds, director of Alcheringa Gallery in Victoria, BC and Dr. Carol Mayer, Curator for Oceania and Africa at the Museum of Anthropology. Elaine has for many years championed the art of the Northwest Coast and the Sepik River. She is perhaps the only person in the world who sells the work of Papua New Guinea artists as the work of individual artists instead of cultural curios. Carol has long championed the arts of Oceania and Africa as living art traditions. The exchange inspires the most magnificent projects either of the carvers has ever undertaken."

He gets to see how far both will go to get rid of the other, and boy do they go far.. A levelheaded lawyer, Gavin D'Amato, has a worried client sitting in his office. This client is going through a divorce, obviously his first. So to make sure this quiet unnamed man plays his cards right, Gavin tells him the story of what happened to a colleague and former client: Oliver Rose. Oliver was a fair-game law student who met Barbara, a gymnast who lived for the thrill of the moment. They both shared a love for exquisite possessions and married right away. Their differences finally caught with them after 18 years, and they ended up in a bitter divorce. But divorce was anything but a solution, as custody of their possessions escalated beyond anyone's, even Gavin's help. It's been seventeen beautiful and prosperous years full of love and understanding for the once inseparable young lovebirds Barbara and Oliver Rose, nevertheless, now the love is gone. As a result, the couple embittered and determined to let all these years go down the drain, they desperately want out, except for one little problem: neither Oliver nor Barbara is willing to leave empty-handed. Under those circumstances, the couple is bound for an unnecessary, yet explosive and utterly catastrophic head-to-head collision, in a no-holds-barred civil war between sexes with their lavish mansion as the precious spoils of war. Without a doubt, theirs is a sad story, however, is there any marriage destined to succeed? After all, Barbara and Oliver's divorce lawyer is deeply sceptical. As a cautionary tale, Washington DC based divorce lawyer Gavin D'Amato tells a potential new client the story of the Roses, Oliver and Barbara. The Roses fell in love at first sight when they were both poor college students - he on scholarship at Harvard Law, and she on a gymnastics scholarship at Madison - meeting by chance at an auction when they were both bidding on the same art piece. Through the early part of their marriage, they both seemed to be striving for the same thing, prestige and the image of perfection, they coming at it from two different directions. Oliver, the breadwinner, did everything he could to impress his bosses to make partner so as to make more and more money, while Barbara spent that money creating what they both considered the perfect showcase home, the house itself which she stumbled upon and bought relatively inexpensively on a white lie. In having that different focus, Barbara, after ostensibly making the house that perfect home and becoming empty nesters with their two children going off to college, realizes that she has lost any sense of herself, which she largely blames on Oliver, who in turn is oblivious to her unhappiness in his sole goal of that outward perfection and prestige, oblivious that is until she asks for a divorce. As the symbol of that prestige and perfection, both are unwilling to give up the house in the divorce settlement. Out of circumstance, both are living in the house during the divorce proceedings, with both their children, when home, and their housekeeper Susan being pawns and potential collateral damage in each doing whatever to get the other to leave and give up the house in the settlement."

15151," 50 Years of Fabulous recounts the rich history of the Imperial Council, one of the oldest and most influential LGBT organizations in the world, from its genesis as a critical public space for the community and capacity building of LGBT San Franciscans, to its vital role in the advocacy for LGBT human rights; the film documents the full scope of the organization's historical evolution up to its contemporary struggle in finding relevance, both in the wake of social progress it has helped foster, and in light of a newly empowered political coalition committed to rolling back a half-century of civil rights achievements. The Imperial Council emerged in 1960s San Francisco against the backdrop of institutionalized vitriol towards the LGBT community. With no anti-discrimination protections for LGBT citizens, police extortion of gay friendly bar owners was rampant, and mass arrests of LGBT bar patrons coupled with the publishing of their names in newspapers was routine. At the time, homosexuality was classified as a mental disorder, leaving LGBT individuals subject to committal to a psychiatric institution for electric shock treatment. In 1961, frustrated by this escalating harassment, community leader and drag performer Jos茅 Sarria ran for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, as the first ever openly gay candidate for public office in the United States. Despite losing, Sarria garnered nearly 6,000 votes, motivating him to build on this emerging base of LGBT political capital by founding the Imperial Council. Created as a volunteer operated social club in 1965, the Council operated under the banner of the Tavern Guild, the first ever gay business association in the country, and began hosting events typically featuring drag performances at gay friendly bars throughout the city. Over time a hierarchy formed, the pinnacle of which was the annual crowning of an ""Emperor"" and ""Empress,"" two people charged with organizational stewardship and fund-raising for a yearlong term. The Council played urgent dual roles in the city, providing critical refuge for the LGBT community, and raising funds for pressing community work. As the religious right pushed for homophobic policy to thwart early 1970s LGBT legislative gains, an LGBT activist movement grew in San Francisco. The Council played a pivotal role in the movement's sustainability, fund-raising for its various campaigns and organizations. Furthermore, as the Reagan administration ignored the AIDS epidemic devastating the LGBT community in the 1980s, the Council again played an essential role, donating over $100,000 annually in fund-raising proceeds to AIDS organizations. In addition, Emperors and Empresses of Council chapters in various cities founded direct service AIDS organizations, further filling the chasm left by government inaction. Following a half-century of LGBT progress, the Imperial Council finds itself at a crossroads. During various historical flash points, the Council's role was self-evident, providing support for advocacy efforts and an inclusive space for LGBT identity expression. Much work remains, but many galvanizing LGBT justice fights have been resolved and advocacy efforts mainstreamed. In this environment, maintaining the volunteer run organization, replete with the bureaucracy of most fifty-year old organizations, has proven to be difficult. Despite significant LGBT gains, the Imperial Council has not outlived its usefulness. Locally, intensifying economic stratification disproportionately impacts the LGBT community, with 30% of San Francisco's homeless population identifying as such. Nationally, the election of Donald Trump, his subsequent appointment of anti-LGBT cabinet members and the specter of new Supreme Court Justices undoing marriage equality, leaves decades of civil rights progress under threat. In this climate, the Council has an imperative role to play, providing support to the LGBT community as it bears the brunt of a city and country becoming increasingly inhospitable to its needs."

10749," Modern Christians desire relevancy, yet an overwhelming majority have never heard a practical message on the topic of birth control.

11940," Memory is not a thing. It has no mass and occupies no space. But if the average human memory, accumulated through one lifetime is made up of 280 quintillion bits of information, then there must be some mode of organization, some unit of storage, something that allows us to maintain it, to carry it, treasure it, horde it. Using 8mm footage shot of one family during the 40s and 50s, this short film is a poetic meditation on, not only the science behind the mechanisms of memory, but the implications of such on an individual's identity. Using physics as a philosophy, this film addresses questions of the self through the effects of time and space. ""An Anatomy of Memory"" challenges our ideas of evolution and humanity - and does not bother to disguise the vastness of death."

13418," HEARTS of TANGO is a documentary film produced in Toronto, Canada. It describes the ""tanguero"" landscape of the city, giving voice to different players of the local scene, who share their passion for this multicultural expression of life. It includes students and instructors, musicians, DJ's, performance dancers, ""Milongas"", and special events organizers. Searching for answers to what the Tango means to them, the documentary asks: What is its universal attraction? What awakens them to this passion? What makes them live it so intensely, and how do they find expression in it? HEARTS of TANGO also seeks to demonstrate that the typical sound of this music does not belong only to the city of Buenos Aires, but it is somehow connected to the concept of the city itself, through the memory of its past history, and identified in its architecture. In the same way we try on new clothes to see how they fit, this documentary tries on Tango music on the city of Toronto, thus depicting how this new colour and vibrancy fits into its multicultural mosaic. Finally, HEARTS of TANGO makes a full conceptual circle when connecting the origins of this music to a key piece of Canadian identity: its immigrants. Tango was a result and product of musical traditions brought to South America by different immigration waves during the first decades of the 20th Century. Now, the time has come to explore its migration to Toronto. In the words of its poetry, in each step of its dance and each note of its music, Tango speaks of love and passion, sadness and longing, and loss and hope. Milonga: noun. Both, a dance hall where Tango is danced, and also a Tango dance with a faster rhythm."

13362," Inspired by the 2006 Academy Award沤 nominee for Best Foreign Language film, ""Water,"" this documentary tells the story of some of the 20 million Indian widows who are abandoned by their families and literally turned out into the streets when their husbands died. ""Water"" was a fictional recounting of this terrible tradition, set in 1938. ""The Forgotten Woman"" is true, and happening today. Gifted to her husband and his family at the age of 5, and after becoming an adult a young woman subsequently gave birth to 10 children. Most of the children re-locate, never to be heard from again, the husband passes away, and this lady ends up at Vrindavan. Another lady, married at the age of 11, and who also ends up at Vrindavan after the passing of her husband. These 2 heart-wrenching stories are just the tip of the iceberg, amongst many other equally painful stories of women, forced to live in destitute conditions. They believe they will obtain Moksha at this holy site, but wear drab clothes, no ornaments nor make-up, are only permitted to wear colorful clothes during Holi. They sing at the Bhajan Mandir, paid a pittance, fed rice and lentils, often sexually molested, and shunned by everyone. Eighty percent these widows come from West Bengal, while others re-locate here from Rajasthan, Gujarat, and other locations. This movie also documents ground breaking work done by some woman's organization, and the apathy shown by politicians in a country that ostensibly claims to be nuclear-powered, and hi-tech, while most Indians are not even aware of the plight of these women, including the Mrityu Ghar (Death House), where quite a few aged and ailing widows end up spending their last days on Earth."

She and her children live in daily fear. ""How do you teach a child in South Africa not to be afraid?"" asks Johannes, the town's retired pastor,""it has been so emphasized in our history"". Fear causes people to become more insular, more insecure and the culture of fear feeds on itself. This is a unique and thought-provoking insight into South Africa today. To understand these people who are being pushed to the limit of their imaginations, is to feel their fears and walk in a forest of unknown things."

Originally created for The Nature of Things, Barbara Doran's ""The Man Who Studies Murder"" provides an overview of Leyton's lifework, distilling his wisdom and humour. He compares three of the world's significant murder cultures: Canada, Britain and the US. In Britain, he tells us, murder rates dropped when the phrase ""Revenge belongs to the magistrate"" was used to describe the official legal philosophy of prosecuting blood feuds. When the power to seek revenge was stymied on a personal level, but satisfied on a governmental level, murder decreased. In Newfoundland, the Canadian province with the lowest murder rates, and Leyton's home turf, he describes the existence of a haggling system wherein the seller undersells and the buyer overpays until they reach a happy medium. For Leyton, this is a culture where courtesy and backbiting and gossip and community essentially keeps the dark urges at bay. To establish the many contrasts between American and British philosophy he compares James Bond to Rambo. If ""Bowling for Columbine"" was a question, ""The Man Who Studies Murder"" is the reply."

Liz inherently already feels like a bad mother as she can't produce enough milk to breastfeed. Although she has friends who are parents, she feels she can't intrude on their already busy lives. She gets some relief when she hires slightly older Yazmina to do some of the domestic work, with she also able to look after Nica in extenuating circumstances. However, Liz does not want Yazmina ever to give Nica a bottle unless truly necessary in Liz feeling this the most fundamental and intimate act in showing Nica that she is his one and only mother. One day while playing with Nica in the park, Liz meets Rosa, a working class factory worker, and her newborn daughter Clarisa, the two mothers who instantly bond. Through Rosa, Liz eventually also meets her sister, Renata. Because of Yazmina and Rosa, Liz begins to feel like some of her life is again her own in reconnecting with friends and work. However, Liz slowly begins to regret having met Rosa, who she feels is taking more out of their friendship than she is giving, especially as she can see directly the true relationship between Rosa, Renata and Clarisa, that relationship which Rosa somewhat misrepresented. As Liz again begins to feel overwhelmed with Rosa, Renata and even Yazmina adding to her stress rather than taking it away, Liz, with a somewhat clouded mind due to her emotions, has to decide what to do especially about having Rosa and by association Renata in her life."
15504," Sam Jinks' sculptural work sustains the briefest and often most private moments in time. Emotional vulnerability is both the subject and result of his work and moves audiences in a way not expected from contemporary art. For Jinks, his works are not literal representations, but are based on the combination of different stages of life. Jinks uses these themes of old and new to suggest unrealized potential: the figures are frozen in time, simultaneously at the beginning and end of life. This can be interpreted either as a melancholy reflection of loss, or as the experience of generations standing together with the awareness of life cycles and different stages of development. His hyper-real sculptures have been described as 'poignantly beautiful' as his works create a dialogue on both a technical and emotional level through a strong sensitivity to detail. Created from silicone, fiberglass, resin, calcium carbonate and human hair these works contain a profound sense of the vulnerability and are remarkable in their striking portrayal of the human condition. Jinks' work can be found in various public collections that include: McClelland Gallery + Sculpture Park, Victoria, Australia ,Shepparton Art Gallery, Victoria, Australia, The Kiran Nader Museum of Art, Dehli , Indian and the Museo Escultura Figurativa Internacional Contemporaenea (MEFIC), Portugal, in addition to various private collections within Australia and internationally."

Of particular interest are Jaquet-Droz's 'The Writer' (1774) and Merlin's 'The Silver Swan' (1773) which beautifully illustrate the degree of technical mechanical sophistication achieved by artisans over 240 years ago. There is also a funny aside: the record Prof. Schaffer places on the turntable at the end (columbia LX466, 1935 impression) is the Beethoven String Sonata Opus 132 and not the Symphony 7 so BBC used any old record and overlaid the sound track."
15908," Two Impossible Films is an art gallery ""conceptual"" film, consisting in two feature films but whose opening & closing credits only are actually shown. The first film is an adaptation of Marx's ""The Capital"" such as Eisenstein was planning to do it until he got the interdiction by Stalin. It starts a bit like ""Zabriskie Point"" (by Michaelangelo Antonioni), in a college classroom with a debate held between students. The second film, humbly called ""A History of Psychoanalysis"" is meant to talk about the missed encounter, in 1932, between Sigmund Freund and Samuel Goldwyn, who was planning to ask the Austrian physician to write a film about psychoanalysis. For both films, opening credits are displayed while the film starts (35 mm film, with a cast & extras & shootings on location), but once the name of the director has been displayed, the screen turns black and for a few seconds, white lines read ""story development"", ""emotional apex"", ""plot resolution"" until full end credits (with mostly imaginary names I guess) start to roll down for over 5 minutes, with all the legal mentions, logos and thanks at the end. By creating a frustration over two legendary projects that were never put to completion, Mark Lewis first pretends to watch cinema as an art form tightly tied to our recent history. An art form also subject to reinterpretations according to the links it has precisely developed with the philosophical pillars of our society (psychoanalysis, politics). The result is a strange, ironic, beautiful (even plastically speaking) experience for movie lovers who will understand the meaning of this high profile hoax, started in 1995 and that Lewis has kept on working on, titling the whole project ""cinema in parts"""

11296," Even if this affirmation may seem strange to us today, neither the Mexican cowboys, or charros, nor mariachis and tequila had necessarily to become the signs that represented Mexico within and outside of its national borders. Why is the mariachi Mexican and not, for example, the rich tradition of fandango from Huasteca or Vera Cruz? Why tequila and not mezcal from Oaxaca or pulque from the highlands? Why the Creole cowboy and not the northern cow herder or the tzeltal from Chiapas, or even the part-indigenous man from the Yucatan? Charro, mariachi and tequila: local products catapulted to the position of national representatives. They are no doubt richer in their origin than their mediated branding has afforded them. In this program we will witness the motives behind why history and the country's turbulent circumstances decided, at one time, that Jalisco was Mexico."

They pick through the dregs of America's schizophrenic culture and piece them back together. What you end up with is a caricature of the black and bloated heart that pulses greed through the US economy. The artists push further into the pulp to grab the attention of passersby, plastering art that's both vulgar and intensely visceral onto the gnarled surfaces of the urban landscape. The film gives us intimate look at some of the giants of this modern subculture. Outside of their own circle, they're virtually unknown. But within their ranks they make up an army of bareknuckle brawlers, publicly arguing the aesthetic merits of octopus imagery and hairy 70s porn stars. They've created their own visual language for describing the spotty underbelly of western civilization and they're not shy about throwing it in the face of polite society. Along the way, they manage to create posters that are strikingly obscene, unflinchingly blasphemous and often quite beautiful.

But surprising facts remain: Roughly 50 percent of those admitted to hospital for heart attacks have ""normal"" cholesterol levels. Many people with high cholesterol have healthy hearts. How much do we really know about cholesterol? Have our attempts to lock up this culprit really worked? And what cutting-edge clues are scientists now discovering to defeat heart attacks? The Cholesterol Question is a hard-hitting investigation into the heart of cholesterol's controversial journey, from essential biological substance to Public Enemy Number One to possible rehab. From high-tech labs at Harvard University, the Cleveland Clinic, and McMaster's Population Health Research Institute to a secluded lakeside village in northern Italy, we join scientists searching for the ""dark matter"" that could unlock the remaining mysteries of heart disease. Is it in our genes, stomachs, or our artery walls? Is saturated fat the villain it's long been made out to be - and are statins actually not the magic bullet to heart health? Told as a film-noir detective story with colourful, graphic novel-inspired animation, The Cholesterol Question deconstructs cholesterol's fascinating story for the average viewer - taking them through a scientific caper that debunks conventional wisdom and travels to the frontiers of heart health for new answers."

13236," Who Am I To Stop (WAITSI) is a semi-observational exploration of isolation, art, and transformation after traumatic brain injury. We follow a young, mixed-race woman, a young, white man, and a middle-aged, white woman from the Pacific Northwest with brain injury. Despite vastly different experiences, all are beginning to test the waters of public performance and re-define a new life path as artists. Rather than define brain injury survivors by their deficits and limit their narratives to crash and recovery stories, we allow them to examine their lives, struggles, triumphs, self-doubt, goals, and personal agency. The film reveals art-making not as rehabilitation but a way to reconnect to a sense of purpose and pride, to protest disability stigma and social isolation, and to contribute to society. Brain injury survivors are not individuals on a private journey of healing; they are rooted in society, one that is often inaccessible and not understanding or accommodating. We give priority to the survivors' stories and perspectives rather than interviewing doctors, researchers, experts, and family. WAITSI faces difficult topics, allowing a thoughtful unfolding of questions around poverty, homelessness, suicidality, who might be to blame for the injury, and how each survivor can now take control of their own lives and flourish. Living life with brain injury disability requires the utmost creativity, and art becomes both a meaningful practice and a metaphor for life with disability."

Like many small towns across the U.S., Harrisonburg, VA is struggling through rapid development. Few areas of the city remain untouched by the combination of factors conspiring to change Harrisonburg. Even though I now lived hundreds of miles from my hometown, I felt a personal loss. I first felt this loss when the house I was brought home to as a newborn was torn down, along with those of all the neighbors I had grown up with, in order to accommodate several parking lots and office buildings for JMU. Now my actual street, Patterson St., is, as I write, being removed from the map of the city due to the building of a new academic building for the campus across the street's former entrance. My high school had been leased to JMU; the hospital I was born in has been sold to them as well. Also long time residents I knew were chafing against the changes and felt alienated in their own city.

11714," It wasn't long after the first Earth observing satellites blasted into space that scientists began using data they gathered to study the poles. With the majority of polar territory sequestered by bitter temperatures and remote, forbidding terrain, experts took immediate advantage of this new orbiting omnipresence. But satellite observations are challenging to understand if you're not well versed in the language. The science of the cryosphere presents a steep learning curve to non-experts, too, and despite its growing relevance over the past few decades, it's not a subject that easily entices general audiences. The science is hard; so too is the translation of that science into ordinary language that captivates and educates. But like the research itself, it matters that non-scientists gain a broader understanding about how the world works. With activities surrounding the International Polar Year serving as a launching pad, media professionals, scientists, and administrators at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center decided to focus their forces at the ends of the Earth. Early into the process the filmmakers realized the story concerned more than just the poles. The cryosphere includes places on Earth where temperatures do not generally rise above water's freezing point, and to properly describe the nature and characteristics of global ice, it was imperative to take a more complete view of the world's overall frozen inventory."

In stark black and white, Fireland cross-cuts numerous witnesses with hundreds of primary remnants of the fire - from photos to the infamous Zapruder footage of Kennedy's assassination (the only color footage in the film). 'America's Holocaust,' as it was called in the few papers that reported on the fire, has tremendous historical and social importance. Twenty-one of its unclaimed victims were buried in a mass grave when Ohio would not pay for individual burials. And while the media largely ignored it, the fire was the impetus for strict regulations on the state and federal levels. Patients died chained to their beds. They varied in age from 17 to 100. Their home had no sprinkler system, only three fire extinguishers, and phones that didn't work. They had only two staff persons to help them. They had no chance. They were quickly forgotten by everyone besides a quiet mid western community. No longer. The day after John F. Kennedy's assassination, 63 Ohioans lost their lives in the Golden Age Nursing Home Fire. Twenty-one were left unclaimed and buried in a mass grave. Fireland interconnects archival photographs, current interviews and the infamous Zapruder footage to dissect a forgotten tragedy that has lasting ramifications today.

Kennedy's assassination."

He walks along the small forecourt overlooking rue du Mont-Cenis, he's absorbed in his thoughts till he catches sight of a very beautiful young woman that he knows quite well standing a little further. She's in front of him, with her back turned to him. This very beautiful young woman is drawing a portrait of a very distinguished beautiful lady of around fifty years old standing in front of her with her German Shepard dog on a leash. The priest watches the scene discreetly and in silence. The young woman ends her portrait and gives it to the lady, she takes her money, takes her tools that she puts in her rucksack and she bends her easel. In that very moment she barely turns and sees the young priest smiling at her while he calls her name: Rachel. The young priest that Rachel calls Philippe asks to Rachel how she is. After a short friendly conversation they both greet each other while going on opposite directions. Rachel makes quickly her way towards home, along Rue Lepic while Philippe goes back to the church.

In the same quarter Nena, a young homeless woman is asking for charity at the corner of a street. In the night she reaches a camp along the dock next to the Stone Bridge where she sleeps. One night she shares some food and a bottle of wine with a small homeless family: the man plays the kaval, he has a young wife and a little girl. Sometimes the dog goes to see Nena and gives her something to eat. Nena enjoys his company. Likewise when she has food, she shares it with the dog. One day a young Catholic priest passes by Nena and gets close to her. He's walking quickly in the company of a rich man. While the priest speaks with the rich man about trips to Europe and a meeting he just looks at the young woman with compassion and smiles without stopping. One evening the priest is sat down in a sports bet agency. He takes off his banicka with meat from the bakery bag. He starts eating a bit. Next to him three big cans of beer lie on the table, two already opened. He opens the third can and looks at his ticket. Two young men seem to speak about the result of a football match, but the priest is drunk and he misunderstands a part of the speech. As the priest understands that he lost the bet he stands up enraged, he goes out from the agency where he throws the half of his banicka with the paper towels and his ticket rolled in a small paper in the bakery bag in a garbage can along the street. The street dog approaches to the garbage can, smells the scent of banicka and takes the bag in his mouth. He crosses the Vardar river and shows up in the camp where Nena usually sleeps. She's there, wrapped in two warm blankets. The dog wants to share the food inside the bag with her. He puts the bag close to her hand and he wakes her up. Nena opens the bag, hugs the dog and shares the half of banicka with him. After having eaten she opens the bag to take a paper towel when she notices a small paper rolled in a ball. She takes the small rolled paper off: it's a sports bet ticket. The following morning Nena goes to a sports bet agency. A man working there verifies the bet and he states that it's actually a winning ticket. Few weeks later Nena sits at the table of a coffee bar with her dog. She's drinking a coffee with a friend. They speak for a little while, and then her friend leaves. Nena remains alone with her dog. She finishes her coffee and when she's about leaving, she notices the young priest sat at few tables far from hers. He's drinking alcohol alone and he looks sad and depressed. Nena stands up with her dog and approaches the table. The young priest looks up. The young woman sits with him and they start to talk. Under the sky of Paris Rachel is sat on a bench. She ends rereading Nena's letter, her cousin who will go to see her soon. The lady of the portrait sat next to Rachel proposes her to go to drink something at the cafe nearby."

This dramatic film, set in a Japanese American internment camp during the World War II, explores one family's experience and examines the sacrifices and triumphs of those who endured and survived through perseverance, courage, and the all-American game of baseball. During World War II, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, ordering the forced removal and incarceration of all people of Japanese ancestry living on the West Coast. These people, most of whom were American citizens, were taken from their homes and sent to ""relocation"" camps in desolate, isolated areas. These camps were surrounded by barb wire and guard towers.

Another severe crisis took place in the lives of the hill people when, since 1979, the Bangladesh government, by its own initiative, began to bring plain land Bengalees from outside and settled them in an artificial manner in the CHT. After two decades of armed conflict a peace accord was signed in 1997 between the Bangladesh government and the Shantibahani the armed wing of the PCJSS, the political organization of the Hill people.

12711," Every year many thousands of people visit the mighty Nanjing Yangtze Bridge.Every year dozens of them have no intention of leaving the bridge alive. But there is one person determined not to see them plummet to their deaths: Chen Si. For some 13 years now he has sacrificed every free weekend to patrol back and forth across the bridge on his motorcycle. Today, having pulled more than 200 desperate souls back from the brink, Chen Si has become a national hero and saving lives his profession.This documentary delves into the hearts and minds of three people who were saved by Chen Si at various stages in his career. In doing so it sheds light on a people squeezed between post-communist dreams and the harsh laws of unmitigated capitalism. In the midst of all this we find Chen Si, trying to cope with his role but struggling with life just like all the others around him. Why live? Why die? What's the meaning of it all? And Chen Si has his own personal story to tell... The central section of the Nanjing Yangtze Bridge is a milelong twostorey steel monster, on which for almost 50 years millions of trains, buses, cars, cyclists and pedestrians have crossed China's greatest river. Once, under Mao Zedong, it was the pride of Chinese architecture. Today it is best known for the large number of suicides who hurl themselves from it into the torrents of the Yangtze. In the midst of stinking exhaust fumes and deafening traffic Chen Si, dressed in his bright red uniform, keeps a lookout for potential suicides. For over ten years he has spent every weekend riding his electric scooter to and for over the bridge to save those intents upon killing themselves. Where others avert their eyes or hurry away he looks and strides into action sometimes with words of sympathy, sometimes with brute force. Lacking psychological training, he can only follow his instincts. The illiterate Xue Fang, who saw no future for herself after the accidental death of her husband, was dragged back into life by Chen Si. In a flat converted intotemporary refuge he coaxed her worries out of her and dealt pragmatically with her personal affairs. Then he left her again to her fate. What has become of this woman and her two student sons and what does she think of her rescue today? These are two of the questions - no longer of interest to Chen Si - which the film pursues. By contrast, Lao Shi, one of the first people saved by Chen Si, is still a friend today. From the first, the two of them had a common ally: alcohol. Lao Shi uses it to fight his depressions, always hoping for Chen Si's support, but all the latter can offer him is company. Lao Shi constantly vacillates between powerless rage and resignation on the one hand, and almost touchingly naive visions of a utopian future on the other. And then there is Lao Zhang, an itinerant worker cheated by a construction gang, full of worldweariness and selfcontempt. At first Chens Si peps him up with alcohol, too; then he buys him a ticket back to his native village. But what awaits Lao Zhang there is truly no idyll of rural family life - With time Chen Si has matured into a media star. Outwardly he plays a sort of Chinese John Wayne, is courted by TV shows and honoured by volunteer associations. But inside him a fight rages between the desire for fame, recognition and money from donations, on the one hand, and the heavy burden of despair and hopelessness with which he is constantly confronted on the other. His own family life also suffers under the traces left in him by this conflict."

It is also worth noting that director G谩bor B贸dy later, in 1983 made a feature film under the title ""Dog's Night Song""."

15383," It's winter in a small southern Norwegian town in the late nineteenth century. After years of struggling, Dr. Thomas Stockmann and his family - his wife Catherine, their young adult daughter Petra, and their two adolescent sons Ejlif and Morten - have returned to town after being away for five years up north, he now well respected and successful as the medical resident of the Health Institute at Kirsten Springs, where he is also a board member. He devised the springs and institute as a center of therapeutic benefits on his own, but developed it with his brother, the town mayor, Peter Stockmann, who is the board chair. They have reinvigorated what was the financially crumbling town. Peter takes credit for giving Thomas this air of respectability, something that has never been important to Thomas, who would rather be seen as a man of conviction in doing the right thing. In this respect, Petra takes after her father. Thomas often writes articles for the local activist newspaper, The People's Daily Messenger, as part of doing the right thing. The Messenger's editor, Hovstad, who is attracted to Petra, sees the mayor as part of a group of townsfolk in positions of power solely for their own benefit - an old boys' club. Thomas' latest article, not yet published and what he wanted to investigate during the springs' off season before tourists start arriving in the spring, concerns the water supply at Kirsten Springs. As he feared, in the board's decision to locate the institute's water supply in the cheapest site and in the process dismissing Thomas' original recommendations, the water is being polluted, contaminated by being located downstream from a tannery. Through the story, Thomas wants to protect the overall public health, and does not want to be seen as a hero or extraordinary in doing so. When Peter finds out about the article, he does whatever he can to quash the story, including fear mongering, intimidation and using the power of being both the mayor and the board chair. His primary concern is increasing the viability of the institute by increasing the number of visitors, while doing as little as possible to increase costs, fixing the water problem, which he is not convinced even exists, being cost prohibitive. Although not his direct motivation, Peter is not averse to ruining Thomas' reputation in the process, making Thomas an enemy of the public which would make it easier to protect his own interests even more. Based on a play by Henrik Ibsen. A small forest town is trying to promote itself as a place for tourists to come enjoy the theraputic hot springs and unspoiled nature. Dr. Stockmann, however, makes the inconvenient discovery that the nature around the village is not so unspoiled. In fact, the runoff from the local tanning mill has contaminated the water to a dangerous degree. The town fathers argue that cleaning up the mess would be far too expensive and the publicity would destroy the town's reputation, so therefore news of the pollution should be suppressed. Dr. Stockmann decides to fight to get the word out to the people, but receives as very mixed reaction. A small-town doctor discovers that, for economical reasons, his colleagues propose to conceal that the local health spa is contaminated by tannery water."

12217," A film about Riazan photographer Evgeny Kashirin (1949-2007), who recorded a poignant visual, social, and cultural history of his time and place, and who inspired three generations of young people to see meaning and beauty in the world around them. From the age of 19, Kashirin captured his time and place, the central Russian province of Riazan, through the lens of his black and white camera. Our film tells (t)his story through the words of his students and acquaintances, his photographs, and footage of the photographer's own projected film compilations accompanied by his haunting blank verse. Together they take the form of a triptych: a dying rural life, a train, and the story of a man who traded his wife for a marble statue of Judith.In the film's prelude, Kashirin visits the remains of the church and the cemetery of his childhood home in the village of Zatishe on a cold autumn afternoon. Zatishe is difficult to translate into English, the closest approximation is ""Lull."" Despite the gray day Kashirin is alive and energetic as he lopes through the high grass. A young man speaks of the ways in which Kashirin opened up a world for him in a dark room in a dreary Soviet city. A city and a world that Kashirin helped him see in a new way. The photographer shepherded three generations of young people in a dilapidated center for youth technical arts in downtown Riazan. He defended this coveted space in a city and a country where space was always at a premium. Kashirin's photographs blatantly contradict the views of some ""specialists,"" according to whom Kashirin was not a ""true historian"". But his massive archive of photographs is a vivid and poignant visual social and cultural history of his times. It is a history that is alive in its very rawness and beauty. The first panel of the triptych is ""Lull."" It is the story of Kashirin's ""grandmothers,"" Klava and Frosia, one an abandoned orphan and the other the wife of a priest, both on the margins of official Soviet society. They lived, worked, and survived together for fifty years. Eternal, peasant Russia? Yet when the two old women reluctantly accept a television, pressed on them by their grandson, it is the May Day parade they like best. The second panel is ""Movement."" People on a slow train that crawls from town to town passing the villages of Riazan along the way. Again, life is unfolding, captured in stills showing a Russia that not many foreigners ever see, while the haunting voice of the photographer closes upon the last image: ""And again children, again a dream, again movement, glances..."" The third part of the Triptych is ""The Stone Woman."" A man travels to Leningrad to buy furniture, and comes back with a marble woman. In disgust his wife leaves him but she is easily replaced as he paints for his sculpture, he buys her companions, and celebrates her birthday on the 8th of March. ""The Stone Woman"" is the photographer's own journey, ""away from the light of the banal Riazan streets"" because ""everyone wants to live in beauty."" The Epilogue revisits the same ruined church of Zatishe, the graves of Klava and Frosia, now overgrown with weeds. The scenes were shot a few days after Kashirin's death. The black and white photographs have been replaced by the intense and almost suffocating colors of summer."

12819," Hubert Butler was a leading voice in post World War 2 human rights, using insights he had gathered working and writing in Eastern Europe before and after the war. He exposed the scale of the Nazi inspired Croatian genocide and his work focused on the role played by the Christian Churches, in particular the Catholic Church. For this work he was labelled a communist in his home country of Ireland which was exorcised by the imprisonment of the Archbishop of Zagreb Aloysius Stepinac in 1946. As Butler was being silenced at home, Ireland was playing host (perhaps unwittingly) to former Croatian war-time Minister of the Interior Andrija Artukovic. Butler subsequently exposed this. Artukovic was finally put on trial in Zagreb in 1985. Above all, Hubert Butler recognised in the impunity of these war-time atrocities the seeds of future discord in Yugoslavia. Hubert Butler became an overnight publishing success at the age of 85 with publications emerging in Dublin, New York, London and Paris."

Though his attempts at achieving justice through channels offered by the system went unrewarded, he refused to let go of the dream that a solution to the problem could be found. He went on a quest for truth and reconciliation, which led him to find living examples of love in action. More than four years in the making, ""WALKING WHILE BLACK: L.O.V.E. Is The Answer"" presents proven action steps to bridge the painful gap between peace officers and the communities they serve. L.O.V.E. is an acronym for Learn about the community and the people in it, Open your heart to the humanity of people in the community, Volunteer yourself to be part of the solution, and Empower others to do the same. Featuring interviews with peace officers, faith leaders, educators, activists and others, the film offers an inspiring blueprint to end racial profiling and heal our communities."
13345," ""The Hope Machine"" maps the elision between live work for the screen and screen work for the stage. The dancers glide between the 'black box' of the famous Theatre Royal in Hobart, the empty space of the ruined Church at the Port Arthur Historic Site, the four live screen spaces of 'The Hope Machine' created by Australian visual artist Simeon Nelson, and the multiple screens created by the directors in filming and post production. Backstage, on stage, on set, on camera, in the stream of technology. Hope, pain, fear, exultation. ""The Hope Machine"" is a contemporary look at the subject of hope with a techno pop edge and a worldly point of view. Choreographed in, on, and around a two story ""hope machine"" created by Australian visual artist Simeon Nelson, the dancers revel in energy which is the engine of hope. This video dance draws fragments of the real world into its choreography making it a dance on hope which is tinged with melancholy - a not quite convinced, but damn willing to try look at creating hope from the exuberance and daring of dance."

Earth as living ecosystem itself is compared to the soil sterilized and destroyed by pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, machine processing - where new crops grow only thanks to another doses of chemical stimulants. In vicious circle, food becomes dependent on and controlled by oil & industry, food barely edible, while seeds - which should not be owned and marketed as such - are reduced to a few state-allowed modified species and sold. The macho-hero approach of controlling, forcing and raping of the earth is becoming the subject of irony, criticism and appeal - in more layers - social, economic, agronomic."

10094," As war-ravaged South Sudan claims independence from North Sudan and its brutal President, Omar al-Bashir, a tiny, homemade prop plane wings in from France. It is piloted by eagle-eyed documentarian Hubert Sauper, who is mining for stories in a land trapped in the past but careening toward an apocalyptic future. Next to UN cargo planes, the tiny aircraft which director Hubert Sauper helped to build looks like a toy. Touching down on grassy strips and military airports in Sudan, shortly before the country's partition in 2011, he visits people and places in one of the world's most politically confusing regions. Sauper meets and interviews both Sudanese and international decision-makers, politicians and profiteers, but he also makes chance acquaintances. He visits Chinese crude oil workers in their barracks as they watch the German science fiction series 'Raumpatrouille Orion', shake their heads at European dreams of being a major power and ponder the cultural gap between themselves and Africans which necessitates certain 'precautionary measures'. The local people on the other side of the fence of the oil fields are afraid of being evicted from their wretched huts. On TV Hillary Clinton claims 'we' don't want a new form of colonialism in Africa, while her compatriots rave about 'win-win situations'. But who exactly is 'we'? The film forgoes an answer to make us aware of the complexity of one of the most controversial questions of our time. A puzzling, challenging and provocative documentary. WE COME AS FRIENDS is a modern odyssey, a dizzying, science fiction-like journey into the heart of Africa. At the moment when the Sudan, the continent's biggest country, is being divided into two nations, an old ""civilizing"" pathology re-emerges - that of colonialism, the clash of empires, and new episodes of bloody (and holy) wars over land and resources. The director of DARWIN'S NIGHTMARE takes us on this voyage in his tiny, self-made, tin and canvas flying machine. He leads us into most improbable locations and into people's thoughts and dreams, in both stunning and heartbreaking ways. Chinese oil workers, UN peacekeepers, Sudanese warlords, and American evangelists ironically weave common ground in this documentary, a complex, profound and humorous cinematic endeavor - a tale of very old and rather sinister verses."

13625," John Lamb Lash, comparative mythologist and author of the classic book, Not In His Image, offers an examination of the truths hidden deep within the ancient Gnostic sects of Europe. Two thousand years ago the Pagan religion of Gnosticism was one of the world's largest religious belief systems. The Gnostics held a deep reverence for the earth in all its wonder and beauty. In contrast to the teachings of the patriarchal and monotheistic religious traditions, the Gnostic creation mythos was centered upon the compelling story of the Wisdom Goddess Sophia.

12143," The city and the snow-covered forest represent polarized elements. The identity of that which is represented, however, remains ambiguous. The thematic form of the film leads to a new intangible perspective, wherein a multiplicity of possible perspectives and meanings lead to a single concept on the horizon. It is a silent narrative which becomes a ""trance"" film. The core concept is built upon the idea of a constantly oscillating shift between two poles, much like the harmonic motion of a guitar string. The identity of positive and negative, or of each of the two opposites, is constantly changing. However, all parallel lines converge as they meet the horizon of human perception."

15490," A depiction of the last twelve hours in the life of Jesus of Nazareth, on the day of his crucifixion in Jerusalem. The story opens in the Garden of Olives where Jesus has gone to pray after the Last Supper. Betrayed by Judas Iscariot, the controversial Jesus--who has performed 'miracles' and has publicly announced that he is 'the Son of God'--is arrested and taken back within the city walls of Jerusalem. There, the leaders of the Pharisees confront him with accusations of blasphemy; subsequently, his trial results with the leaders condemning him to his death. Jesus is brought before Pontius Pilate, the prefect of the Roman province of Judaea, for his sentencing. Pilate listens to the accusations leveled at Jesus by the Pharisees. Realizing that his own decision will cause him to become embroiled in a political conflict, Pilate defers to King Herod in deciding the matter of how to persecute Jesus. However, Herod returns Jesus to Pilate who, in turn, gives the crowd a choice between which prisoner they would rather to see set free--Jesus, or Barrabas. The crowd chooses to have Barrabas set free. Thus, Jesus is handed over to the Roman soldiers and is brutally flagellated. Bloody and unrecognizable, he is brought back before Pilate who, once again, presents him to the thirsty crowd--assuming they will see that Jesus has been punished enough. The crowd, however, is not satisfied. Thus, Pilate washes his hands of the entire dilemma, ordering his men to do as the crowd wishes. Whipped and weakened, Jesus is presented with the cross and is ordered to carry it through the streets of Jerusalem, all the way up to Golgotha. There, more corporal cruelty takes place as Jesus is nailed to the cross--suffering, he hangs there, left to die. Initially, in his dazed suffering, Jesus is alarmed that he has been abandoned by God his father. He then beseeches God. At the moment of his death, nature itself over-turns. The Passion of The Christ focusses on the last twelve hours of Jesus of Nazareth's life. The film begins in the Garden of Gethsemane where Jesus has gone to pray after sitting the Last Supper. Jesus must resist the temptations of Satan. Betrayed by Judas Iscariot, Jesus is then arrested and taken within the city walls of Jerusalem where leaders of the Pharisees confront him with accusations of blasphemy and his trial results in a condemnation to death. This film depicts the final hours of Jesus Christ, starting from His prayers in the Garden of Gethsemane and His betrayal at the hands of Judas Iscariot. It goes on to show the trials He endured under Pontius Pilate and King Herod as well as the torture and ridicule He suffered in between. Once the death sentence is pronounced, He carries a heavy wooden cross to Golgotha amidst throngs of jeering citizens and horrendous beatings, while a few citizens do what they can to help Him. Throughout this time, we are shown memories from His past with His mother and Disciples, where He gives His teachings.

12433," Upasikka, a Sanskrit word which translates as 'servant' or 'attendent', is how the mysterious Mahatmas used to call Helena P. Blavatsky. ""Upasikka, Madam Blavatsky Legend"" is the first feature film on life of Madame Blavatsky, an extraordinary personality of her time, regardless of the way we decide to look at her philosophy. However, the film Upasikka is not a film which praises her work; nor does it defy and debunk what she stood for, in spite the fact that she was one of the most controversial figures of the nineteenth century. Operating within the confinements of the world of fiction, Upasikka charters Madame Blavatsky's indelible legacy and its contagious effect on thousands whom she has had a strong spiritual impression on. Furthermore, the film makes an attempt to capture the deep magical and symbolic reality by going beyond the appearance of things. It invites the audience to the explore the unchartered areas such as occultism, spiritual discourse, astral and transcendental visions. To the tutored eye or the average cinephile, Upasikka could also appear as a hallucination in the late-romantic sensibility. Since Upasikka is the final product of a long and arduous process of research and soul-searching answers for esoteric questions on theosophy, it is a must for those who crave to know more about the life and works of a titanic human being who enriched history through her contribution to Buddhist discourse."

The sequences, which are always meaningful, follow each other seamlessly: conversations and everyday gestures underline little victories and big disappointments.

Whether looking in the mirror for shaving or putting on make-up, there is a succession of mirror effects, where one is really looking for oneself or confronting one's own image and the mask one wears. In Storm in a C-Cup, the impartial eye of the camera reveals ambiguities, little by little bringing questions to light; questions that remain unanswered when the carnival finally arrives, just at the moment when, ironically, all the roles are reversed."

15126," This Chicago-made video centers on a support group for gay men of color; the six members discuss barebacking, fidelity, bisexuality, etc. This is the second installment in a series, funded in part by the Chicago Department of Health, intended to promote HIV awareness. The educational agenda results in some stiff moments (""But why should I get an HIV test?"" ""Well, let me tell you four good reasons...""), but the talented actors do a good job of selling the material and codirectors Sharon Zurek and Lora Branch strike a nice balance between didacticism and drama. By the cliff-hanger ending I cared enough to want to know what happened next. 60 min."

The film stages the production process of vacuum forming a plaster copy from the Ecstasy of Saint Teresa (1647- 1652) by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. The scene is set in an anonymous metal workshop where the operations of the vacuum former and actions of the technician are observed in a highly surveyed arena through multiple disembodied perspectives.

13363," Each beat has its own speed, each tempo suggests certain images: Timo Novotny's video for Richard Dorfmeister's Sofa Surfers remix, which was shot in Japan on Super-8 film, begins with an aerial view of a construction site and a crane. As the bass begins softly, the images start to move up along a vertical line, apparently reflecting the path of an elevator. Everything is transparent, everything is structured: The scaffolding is echoed in the picture's frame, which rolls across the screen in a way similar to a poor film projection, offsetting the illusion of movement. Or the images accentuate the music through superimpositions, short zooms and shots through cloudy glass. A small model of the Statue of Liberty then briefly disorients the viewer, and the vertical movement becomes horizontal, moving from Tokyo to Kyoto: Analogously to the laid-back drum'n'bass, the images then begin a relaxed and aimless journey through Japan's urban spaces. In this phase, the two elements almost unite, in smooth parallel movement. Near the end, the rhythm materializes in the human body. Three kids break-dance in a city park and are then joined by others. While this is not an arrival at a certain destination, it is definitely more than a chance meeting. The escalators at a large train station continue to run mechanically, and the space does not come to rest until the music has faded away. (Dominik Kamalzadeh)"

12947," Prior to the 1994 elections there was a lot of political violence, although it decreased dramatically post '94.

11216," After their orphanage burns down, a group of children are being transported west by train to Manitoba. All of them are available for adoption and at a stop at Scourie, Ontario little Patsy meets Victoria McChesney. Victoria and her husband Patrick have no children and she immediately decides to adopt the girl. The only condition imposed on them is that as Patsy has been baptized a Roman Catholic the Protestant McChesneys agree to raise her as a Catholic. Patsy is a well-behaved little girl whose only real problem is a school bully, also one of the orphans, who spreads stories that she set their orphanage on fire. Problems arise when the local newspaper goes after Patrick, the town reeve and prominent member of his political party. Patrick decides they can't go forward with the adoption. Patsy overhears him and runs away but does so just as the school catches fire. The community quickly decides Patsy is responsible but it's Patrick who comes to her defense. It all ends well. Late nineteenth century Qu茅bec. An adolescent named Patsy is a shy, sensitive child being an orphan, she, illegitimate, having been dropped off anonymously as a baby at the Catholic orphanage where she was raised. Her already fragile self-esteem takes an even bigger hit when the convent and orphanage burn down as she accidentally knocks over a lantern, some of the other children who blame her, especially a boy named Edward who plain just does not like her. The biggest concern for the nuns, who don't blame Patsy for the situation, is to have as many of the children adopted by good Catholic families as there are no other Catholic orphanages that can take them all. The nuns and children travel all over Qu茅bec and Ontario in their mission, advance word being made to the Catholic diocese in each town they visit. A conundrum occurs in the small town of Scourie, Ontario when, having no idea of the situation before the nuns and children's arrival, leading citizen Victoria McChesney falls under Patsy's spell, she who ultimately wants to adopt her. The issue is is that the McChesneys, a childless couple, are Protestants. Victoria arranges with the nuns to adopt Patsy on the condition that she be raised as a Catholic. Victoria arranges all of this without her husband's knowledge, Patrick McChesney who is the town reeve, a mercantile owner/operator, and aspiring provincial politician who some say is potential Prime Ministerial material. He, unlike Victoria who is proceeding on unconditional love, sees the many pitfalls in their lives, including Patsy's, because of the adoption. Indeed, they do face problems, from both Catholics and Protestants who don't understand why they just didn't adopt a Protestant child if they wanted children, from Patrick's political opponents who exploit the issue for their own personal gain, and from some of Patsy's classmates, whose minds have been poisoned by another new child to the town, namely Edward. The question becomes if they can overcome all these obstacles."

Forty years ago, at the 1976 Montreal Games, a team of doped East German athletes thrashed their rivals from the United States, until a remarkable final race. The central player was a transcendent American athlete denied her due and since lost in time: Shirley Babashoff. Babashoff and her teammates were surrogates in a Cold War struggle, who battled a tragic conspiracy with a blazing honesty and a ferocious, endless tenacity. In 1976, the U.S. Olympic swim team entered the Games in Montreal looking forward to its usual dominance. The men did not disappoint, delivering the most dominant performance in Olympic swimming history. They won every race but one, and in that race won the silver and bronze medals. For the women, it was a completely different story. They were overwhelmed by an East German machine that had emerged on the world stage leading up to the Games with frighteningly fast performances. In a competition where 15 American records were set, the U.S. women had only four silver medals and one bronze medal to show for it. After an entire competition of disappointing results, winning no races and facing a critical media that heaped on additional pressure, the U.S. women finally came together to do as a team what they could not do individually. It was the final race when four women stepped to the blocks in an attempt to do what nobody thought possible... win The Last Gold. This is their story."

10196," ""Made In Romania"" is the story of a producer who is given the chance to realize his dream project; to film an adaptation of an obscure, beautifully written Victorian novel, ""The Tides of Reason"". Disillusioned after years of making low budget genre films, the producer readily accepts the demands of his less than legitimate financiers. Namely, the production be filmed entirely in Romania to take advantage of a complicated and slightly suspicious tax deal.  Shot in documentary style, this behind-the-scenes comedy deftly and inexorably exposes the painful reality of runaway film production. Way off the radar in deepest, darkest, rural Romania the hopelessly disconnected production veers swiftly off the tracks as bizarre personalities, cultural, economic and language issues quickly combine to send the production spiraling into hysteria."

Proposal... implies that it is assembled from 'location recce' and audition footage; the by-product of a pre-production process for a low budget science fiction film/architectural documentary, developed this far, abandoned, and only later discovered in an archive.

In the midst of the ship's landing and a cease-fire in the War of Independence, Ben Gurion gave the order to shell the ship, forcing Jews to fire on Jews and almost sparking a civil war. The late Yitzhak Rabin was one of the participants in this event and is interviewed here along with many other eye witnesses.

However, it is given to them to walk the road of the beautiful light passing its stages of sensual pleasure and spiritual pain, both of which appear in the pictures because a picture is able to organize and interpret the phenomena of life in a cognitive motion. It compares what is comparable, and directs what is the different in the same direction. The happiness of the awakening consciousness is nothing but finding the ultimate identity."

15454," Farewell Israel: Bush, Iran and The Revolt of Islam is an historic journey. From the birth of Islam, through its 1,200 year reign over the civilized world, to the last 300 years of Islamic decline. Overtaken and dominated by the West -- then humiliated by a Jewish state. Islam's historic trials with Jews, and its relationship with conquered non-believers, help illustrate the Islamic world view - all through the eyes of Muslims. The confrontation between Islam and the Jews began in the Prophet Muhammad's time, and continues to this day. Israel's existence recalls Islam's age old Jewish problem, first felt at Islam's inception in Medina in 624 AD: How can Islam thrive and find salvation if Jews are politically powerful? And it requires the same solution chosen by the Prophet Muhammad - elimination of political independence of Jews and the domination of Islam over them. Farewell Israel: Bush, Iran and The Revolt of Islam is an historic journey, from the birth of Islam, through its 1,200 year reign over the civilized world, to the last 300 years of Islamic decline, overtaken and dominated by the West -- then humiliated by a Jewish state. Islam's historic trials with Jews, and its relationship with conquered non-believers, help illustrate the Islamic world view - all through the eyes of Muslims. In this groundbreaking film, the total rejection of Israel by Muslim states since its inception in 1948 comes to light as a religious duty for Believers. The Islamic roots of Anwar Sadat's 1977 Camp David Accords with Israel are exposed as ""The Diplomatic Strategy Against Israel,"" by which Egypt sought to defeat Israel through diplomacy, rather than establish ""Western Peace."" Israel's misunderstanding of Islamic goals and values are highlighted by its enthusiasm for Yasser Arafat and the 1993 Oslo Accords. Next, President George Bush's tragic misunderstanding of 9/11 as a ""War Against Freedom,"" in which the United States played into the hands of Al-Qaeda and the Islamist cause by advocating democratic reform across the Middle East, is revealed. Finally, the Iranian agenda for acquiring strategic weapons to eliminate Israel comes clearly into focus. Today, at the direction of Iran, Islamists are preparing for a fateful coming war for Islam - and Israel is the number one target and obstacle in the path of Islamic revival. For Muslims, Israel embodies ""injustice"", and is the ultimate symbol of Islam's decline - a Western, secular society imposed by the West on former Islamic lands. Only with the return of Jews to their historic status as ""Dhimmi"" or ""Tributaries,"" tolerated and protected within Islamic society, can Islamic revival succeed - resulting in ""Islamic Peace"" in the Middle East. Farewell Israel: Bush, Iran and The Revolt of Islam reaches the unavoidable conclusion that Western and Israeli misunderstanding of Islam is leading to a coming war - which will have devastating consequences for the West, and worst of all for Israel - Farewell Israel!"

10756," Indian society weaves a complex matrix of inequality. While the usual divisions of caste, religion and language gradually still, income differentiation has stratified citizens into ever-expanding vertical layers. Identity and worth of an individual is marked by his income. A person moves a step above, by money power, only to find several others on top. This vortex has institutionalized income disparity as those on the lowest steps have little space or opportunity to transcend their status. Leftovers of a sumptuous dinner may feed a family and the expenditure incurred over the meal may sustain some family for a year, amount needed to buy one liter milk beats official requirement to cross poverty line. Worse, we have accepted this cruel classification as a natural consequence of growth, an unpardonable insensitivity that may create irreparable fissures in social fabric."

The mortification of not being able to plead, in times like this, any appropriate gesture, faced with the painful helplessness of the theater, or art more broadly, given the violence and madness, the artist can only try to continue to do their work well. This reflection by Strehler, written on the occasion of the massacre of Piazza Fontana started the idea of this film on the Piccolo Teatro of Milan, whose story is completed by the events of the host city. He always says that the theater is full of ectoplasm, but there, between the holes in Fontana, these are visible and bring us extraordinary memoirs."

When the government threatens to reclaim the bay in the name of ecological restoration, hundreds of families are about to lose their homes.

Because it's about the idea of evil, it goes way beyond Bush; major topics covered include racism, war, Vietnam, criminal justice, capital punishment, and of course the Axis of Evil. It's a reasoned discussion of evil, not a polemic, and the cutting-edge stamp art makes it unlike anything else out there."

But instead of engaging in his usual ""kamikaze"" tactics, he decides to try to ""not push her"". He pursues this tactic to the point of near absurdity and finds himself increasingly befuddled and in pain. But a pattern starts to emerge; every time he is about to give up, some hope-inducing thing happens which sets the wheels of courtship in motion again. But her attitude is consistently and bafflingly inscrutable. A rival appears and then disappears. What does it all mean? Caveh wants to know, but keeps hitting his head against the same wall. Finally he abandons his therapist's advice and follows his own intuition. He doesn't get what he was hoping for, but gets something more precious and ultimately far more real."

10115," Through family photographs, archive footage and, mainly, empty shots of the streets of Buenos Aires, the films recovers fragments from the past of a family. Emigration, separation, longing, loneliness and pain are the ingredients of a raw film where compassion and sentimentalism are absent. A woman meets her brother after 50 years of absence. In those days, Galician people emigrated to Argentina to make money. Five decades later, the grandchildren, orphaned and poor, knock on Europe's door. The long, empty shots, the formal radicalism of the film, are the necessary tools to picture this painful absence."

Women who deliver their babies in prison have few options; if they can't find a family member to care for the infant, they will need to place it in foster care, or choose adoption.

Women who deliver their babies in prison have few options; if they can't find a family member to care for the infant, they will need to place it in foster care, or choose adoption. In any case, the newborn will be separated from its mother at birth, with a very real possibility that the two will never be reunited. Christina, Trisha and Kristin are pregnant, and are facing years behind bars. Their newborns will face an uncertain future. The three women share the personal details of their pregnancies, incarceration and deliveries as they struggle with the agonizing search for safe and healthy homes for their babies -- and as one plan after another falls apart. A fourth inmate, Tangerine, adds the perspective of someone who has already been through it. By contrast, a few states have prison nurseries where inmates can keep their newborns with them. The documentary visits Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in New York, where Dr. Mary Byrne of Columbia University has been studying the development of babies during their first year of life inside a prison environment. As the number of women in prison continues its dramatic rise, her findings may have a major impact on planning to better meet the needs of incarcerated women and their babies."

The programme follows Gail's daily life in great intimacy as she and those closest to her struggle to cope with her obsessive feelings of grotesque ugliness.

15655," Montreal 1948. On Rosh Hashanah, Chaim (a Yiddish writer) is forced to think of his religion when he's asked to be the tenth in a minyan. As he sits in the park, he suddenly sees an old friend whom he hasn't seen since they quarrelled when they were yeshiva students together. Hersh, a rabbi, survived Auschwitz and his faith was strengthened by his ordeal, while Chaim escaped the Nazis, but had lost his faith long before. The two walk together, reminisce, and argue passionately about themselves, their actions, their lives, their religion, their old quarrel, and their friendship. Rosh Hashana 1948. Chaim Kovler and Hersh Rasseyner were childhood friends in Bialystok, Poland, but have not seen each other in years when they were both twenty. Then, they became estranged for an argument they had on the issue of Judaism, specifically about leaving the yeshiva. Since, Chaim has become a Yiddish writer who has turned his back on the faith. Hersh has become an orthodox rabbi. By chance, they run into each other in a park in Montr茅al, where Hersh now lives and where New York based Chaim is visiting on a speaking engagement. Each believed the other had perished in the Holocaust. Initially, the two men forgive each other for the quarrel that has estranged them for all these years. But as they spend the better part of the afternoon together walking through the park and talking about their lives, they find that their individual views of Judaism have only strengthened over time, in large part because of the Holocaust, which claimed the lives of their respective families, including Chaim's wife. The question becomes whether their chance reunion will reunite them or tear them further apart emotionally. If there is one word to describe this movie it is ""guilt."" The guilt of surviving the holocaust while all others perished, the guilt of leaving family members or friends in limbo expecting the sun always to rise tomorrow, and the guilt of loving a g-d that turned his back on his most ardent followers in their time of need. Chaim and the Rabbi, are two childhood friends haunted by both their past experiences and decisions, or are they? The Rabbi not only feels the guilt of losing his friendship with his best friend Chaim, but when his father apologized for his treatment not accepting that apology. Chaim, while he feels bad about the loss of his friendship with the Rabbi, lives with the guilt of not being there for his family in their time of need. Deep down and side he feels guilty for his actions by hiding his cigarette and helping with the minyan. But in the end, Chaim continues to rejects the lifestyle required of an orthodox Jew and walks off into the sunset. In summary, not only this is a relative debate for those that survived the holocaust resulting in those that grew closer to g-d and those further away but is a movie of unique qualities. It reminded me of the old movies with Humphrey Bogart and other greats with the intense drama between two characters and where no one else existed."

15094," ""I have been beaten up from time to time and harassed but that's part of the terrain."" It's shocking to hear this kind of coolness from Beatrice against the images of her covered in bruises and welts from a police beating. However, her bravery does not go unnoticed. She is one of only two Africans to have won the Ludovic-Trarieux International Human Rights Prize, the other being Nelson Mandela. Having suffered great economic and social privations under Mugabe, Beatrice hopes for a better future for Zimbabwe. ""All of us want a basic education for our children, we want basic health facilities for our children, we want basic amenities in our home for our children"", she says. Her belief is that through trying to uphold the rule of law she can achieve these desires. So she takes on all cases where she feels the rule of law has been violated. From Jestina Mukoko, director of the Zimbabwe Peace Project who was detained for 89 days, for investigating human rights abuses, ""I thought I had moved out of my body and I was watching this suffering woman from somewhere else. That's what the pain did to me"". To Roy Bennett, an exiled political activist and White farmer. ""If it wasn't for Beatrice, I'm sure they would have killed me in that prison."" The Mugabe regime is aware of her fight and seeks to slander her at every turn. ""I can tell you Beatrice Mtetwa is not a stickler for the law, she uses the law to push her political agenda."" Jonathan Moyo from the Zanu PF party tells us. In fact the vitriol is so intense that after clearing Beatrice's client, foreign journalist Andrew Meldrum, the judge launched an extraordinary personal attack on her: ""He read his verdict which was an hour long. It was 59 minutes of guilty... and half of the verdict was a character assassination of Beatrice."" Here is an inspiring story that breeds hope for Zimbabwe and yet Beatrice remains inspiringly modest: ""This has to be done. Somebody's got to do it, and why shouldn't it be you?"""

12358," Atlantis is known across the world as a myth. But is this really the truth? No matter what cultural history we explore, we discover a story very similar to the one we know about Atlantis...why? For years, experts and researchers have been looking in the wrong place, at the wrong people and for the wrong thing. For too long historians have focused on a few words left to us by Plato whose meaning they misunderstood. The fact is, even Plato didn't understand what had been told to him. The startling truth is that the remnants of Atlantis are all around us right now and have been for a very long time - long before recorded history. New research and insight exposes Atlantis to be a pivotal part of our ancient beginnings. The legendary lost city that many think of as myth, was in fact a very real and highly advanced civilization that was uniquely aware of the laws of the universe and was able to access hidden dimensions and make contact with extraterrestrial races. This is the story of the real Atlantis. This is the real lost history of mankind itself. ""Fascinating research and evidence of a lost epoch in history."" - OH Krill, author of Montauk Babies. ""Highly entertaining and enlightening."" - United Media Network. ""Philip Gardiner has found the 'Hiram Key' to Atlantis - Bravo!"" - John Jay Harper, author of Tranceformers, Shamans of the 21st Century."

13779," Sophia's Year is a very special film diary. It is a declaration of love for the filmmaker's partner, their children and their friends. An amusing and sensual document about living together. The film also shows life with a camera. The 35mm image is divided into 12 segments (split screen 3 x 4) which stands for the months of the year 1995. From the middle of the year little Sophia is present in the picture 颅 she was born on the 21st of June. The main figure in the monthly ""windows"" is the filmmaker's older daughter who acts for the camera, plays with it or is obviously annoyed by it. The synchronous soundtrack runs through the twelve picture one after another so that one of the segments is brought into the foreground. Sophia's Year is an attempt to cross the serious, formally organized structural film with a spontaneous, emotionally-directed private home movie. An ironic break with the structuralist position and a positive re-assessment of amateur film was most certainly intended. Filming with a Super 8 camera also allows re-consideration of the amateur film as a genre. In any case I really loved filming all those kinds of pictures which are regarded with disdain by the classical avant-garde or are even taboo. I loved filming the flowers or the ripe freshly-picked cherries 颅 in-focus and traditionally composed pictures. Or simply to film my children with a loose hand-held camera without thinking much about it beforehand. It was simply about the fun, the improvisation and allowing accidents to happen."

14152," In Hiroshima, contrary to local people's wish, violence and disturbance are shown up especially on August 6th. Protesters, demonstrators and religious groups occupied Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park entirely, taking advantage of that place for their campaigns. The heart of peace in Hiroshima is no longer at peace. Even though media also regularly come to picture, they are obliged to capture precisely the peaceful images of Hiroshima. They just sit down in front of miserable or mourning people and organize grief reactions to integrate themselves into Hiroshima Peace Memorial Day. Most casual viewers of media will follow those artificial pieces, so that there this is a peace gap between media images and the actual situation in Hiroshima. This gap is what represents Hiroshima culture 70 years after the bomb was dropped. The shots in Above the Ground reveal how this is happening and why this exists. To do so, we filmed using 15 cameras applying the methods of visual ethnography. These methods help viewers develop their spiritual and intellectual muscles to the point where they can acquire accurate knowledge of Hiroshima culture. The film has abandoned the historical analogy of Hiroshima city, and instead, selected pieces that fairly represent the various dimensions of contemporary Hiroshima. No one need be rigidly committed to any single approach to the film. Ultimately the documentary offers audiences different paths toward peace culture of Hiroshima."

11058," Production design has always been a key part of the Hollywood filmmaking process, but until recently the field received very little critical attention. But thanks to Daniel Raim's lucid and concise Oscar nominated documentary about Robert Boyle, one of Hollywood's best art directors, a general audience now has a chance to savor what these masters of their craft have contributed. Boyle tells stories about working on everything from Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest,"" ""The Birds"" and ""Marnie"" to ""Fiddler on the Roof."" Boyle is quite eloquent and witty in explaining his craft, and others, including fellow art director Henry Bumstead, are also interviewed. Raim has done an imaginative job of editing production storyboards and sketches with photographs and film segments so that we 'get' what the production designer actually does. The detailed segment on constructing Mt. Rushmore in the studio (thus the film's title!) is fascinating, as we learn more about how actual photos of a location can be skillfully blended with a constructed set. A special highlight is Raim's coverage of ""The Birds,"" in which Raim has Boyle revisit the actual location as film footage from Hitchcock's memorable film is intercut with continuity sketches drawn for Boyle by his draftsman, Harold Michelson. We see a black-and-white line drawing of Tippi Hedren with a bird attacking her, which then becomes that actual shot in the film. Raim's film is a welcome gift to everyone anywhere who wants to know more about what has and continues to make Hollywood Hollywood."

Impaired access added to the prohibition of making bonfires and hunting further removes this landscape from its original inhabitants. Firewood-perhaps one of the few goods that native people can legally profit from-and fire are definitely the symbol of a culture that has not disappeared. The ideologue of Argentine's Constitution stated, as he was drafting it, ""To govern is to populate... to populate it with people from Europe."" This tension between native or mestizos and the white population in Argentina is very strong up to today, but it still goes largely unacknowledged."

The recently deceased Vogel was a close friend of Skoog's family, but lived a quiet life dedicated to accumulating hours of videotaped television shows and almost aggressively meaningless own projects, which in an almost lexical fashion document the welfare state's invisible corners and waste products in countless works."

14610," Hasidic Jews seem alien, and even hostile, to those outside their culture,which frequently includes other Jews. They dress differently, don't mingle between the sexes, speak Yiddish, and wear side curls, all in an attempt to rigorously follow the commandments of the Torah. They tend to keep to themselves, shunning television and the media so outside influences cannot corrupt their values and views. Yet filmmakers Oren Rudavsky and Menachem Daum were able to enter their world, and the result is the fascinating documentary A Life Apart: Hasidism in America. Using interviews with academics and members of the community and some historical footage, the filmmakers trace the growth of Hasidic groups in the United States. Groups formed around particular Rebbes (learned leaders) and they took their names from their Eastern European home cities (the Satmar Hasids, the Breslov Hasids, and so on). Leonard Nimoy and Sarah Jessica Parker narrate, explaining how this movement came to America and how it was able to flourish. Dissenting voices also appear, in the form of neighborhood people who are distressed at the Hasids' refusal to speak to members not in their community and of a young woman, Pearl Gluck, who left the community in order to pursue her writing and to follow a life of her own choosing. Many Hasids refuse to speak on camera, and we see many shielding themselves with hands or coats so as not to appear on film. But those who do appear are poignant in their discussions of why the Hasidic life is important to them. One man speaks to the directors, even as he acknowledges that he will never see the movie, but he will do it ""in order to help a Jew make a living."" One couple, Holocaust survivors, are not Hasidic, but their children are, and the reasonings of both the parents and the children are interesting. This film, shown on PBS, is a consequential look into a lifestyle many of us don't understand, and it may help in increasing an understanding. In this ""unique glimpse into this closed society"" (Philadelphia Inquirer), seven years in the making, we are taken into the depths of the Hasidim's joyous, sometimes harsh, and often beautiful world. A ""series of beautifully shot, startlingly intimate interviews"" (New York Post)."

12599," In 2000 George Bush Jr was voted into the White House thanks in part to the massive voting power of the evangelical religious right.

12151," From the birth of jazz to the evolution of hip hop; the advents of urban trends to transformative advances in technology, African Americans have played an integral role in molding American culture. Unfortunately, we tend to not be the beneficiaries of our own innovation. Bleaching Black Culture examines the continuum of America's black cultural appropriation and effects on the African American community. The imprint of cultural theft has a long legacy, and this power of influence in music, sports, fashion and art translates into millions of dollars for our country. So, if the AfricanAmerican community is the cultural architect, why are we still outside of the building begging to get in? Cultural branding has not only helped to exploit the hip hop community along with other forms of black art, but it's managed to monetize off of black marginalization. Currently, the Rhythm and Blues billboard chart, a genre developed for the African American voice, is dominated with the likes of Robin Thicke, Justin Bieber, and Adele. Perhaps, it's easier to sell black art when it's masked in ""white face."" Yet the argument with the latter comes from the 2013 African American consumer report. It shows black buying power rising from its current astonishing $1 trillion level to a fore casted $1.3 trillion by 2017. Since the African American community is the number one consumer, it begs to ask - can we take ownership of our cultural influence and convert our buying power into economic capital? Or, with the appropriation of black culture becoming more and more exploitive and lucrative, is admiration the new bastardization?"

Christine won the inaugural $20,000 Zanesville Prize in Contemporary Ceramics, and when Doug Jeck saw her prize-winning piece the next year, when he was a judge in the next competition, he knew this was someone he wanted to work with. The film documents, day by day, how the two artists craft a startling and stunning array of psyches, gazes, and visages. Zanesville, once a rich and bustling town because of its industrial clay production, now one more of the many sagging post-industrial cities in the Midwest, is in the process of reinventing itself with an arts and culture identity. The Zanesville Prize is a key element of this movement, as is the Pioneer School Zanesville (PSZ) project. Duet captures the kind of creativity Zanesville is just beginning to attract."

13456," Welcome to Sunseeker, Britain's biggest superyacht builder, who has been hand-building customised boats for the world's super-rich for the past 50 years. For the first time ever, they have allowed the BBC behind the scenes of their extraordinary production line in Poole and into the rarefied world of the multimillionaire's favourite plaything. The company built their reputation on making small to mid-size yachts, but the recession saw this market flounder as even the super-rich tightened their belts, seeing Sunseeker sink into the red. So in a high-stakes move, they're sinking millions into building a larger, opulent superyacht to reel in the uber-rich who still have cash to splash on life's ultimate luxuries, to help sail them back into profit. The film follows the build of a new 艁20m, 40-metre superyacht and their most challenging specification to date when a customer takes full advantage of their made to measure service and asks for more extras than any other yacht in the history of the company. When it falls behind schedule, we discover it's not all plain sailing when you're in the business of engineering luxury for the super-rich. Whilst the Poole shipyard works hard to meet the customer's exacting standards, the London sales team are working just as hard to fill the order book during the all-important boat show season, where they hope to sell over 艁40m worth of boats in just 30 days. Every boat is built in Poole but is found basking in the international playgrounds of the rich and famous and, filming across the summer season, we also hop on board the charter side of the business to meet the people paying 艁60,000 for just a week's holiday.

13846," We don't know how. We don't know when. But death comes for us all. To be human is to wrestle with this truth and with the great unanswered question: How do we live with death in our eye? To borrow from Dylan Thomas (whose poem opens the film): Do we go gently or raging against the dying light? Or between these two extremes? Do we depart with equanimity or with anger? With clenched fists or more commonly with denial? Or do we see death as something to be fought and even possibly conquered, a challenge increasing pursued by some of the brightest scientific minds. Finally, what are the stories we tell ourselves as we go into the night - or into the light? ""Awakening: Portraits of Life and Death"" features fascinating, unexpected voices from various walks of life, old and young, believers and unbelievers, dying and healthy, well-known and obscure. For them death is no longer an abstraction. Whether through a dire prognosis, the imminence of their own death, the loss of a loved one, a sudden epiphany, or a temperament born to question, these are people who have truly 'awakened' to their mortality. The film is meant to raise ultimate questions, not to provide answers. How could it? Death is ""that undiscovered country,"" as Hamlet so famously described it, ""from whose bourn / No traveler returns."""

Colleagues caught up in a mysterious ancient cult. A side project gone terribly wrong. But these occurrences were not part of the script; they took place in real life behind the scenes of the production. The original concept was daunting enough: a contemporary, sun-drenched re-imagining of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's dark 19th century classic, Notes from the Underground. At the outset, writer/director Vitaly Sumin had a script, a location, a vision, and no budget. But he'd been down this road before; his critically acclaimed previous film, Shades of Day, was an LA story based on another Dostoevsky novella, White Nights. Since he did it once, everyone assumed, he could do it again -- until a tsunami of unforeseen challenges threatened to tear these 'Notes' to shreds. Behind the Scenes -- The Making of Notes from the New World stands as a compelling story in its own right, sure to inspire filmmakers and anyone else who wishes to achieve the impossible. Vitaly sets out to make an LA movie inspired by a Dostoyevsky masterpiece and encounters one disaster after another.The film, Notes From the New World, is rescued by an eleventh hour epiphany and goes on to win multiple international awards."

11629," By 2011, the world will be 10 times more instrumented than it was in 2006. Internet connected devices will leap from 500 Million to 1 Trillion. Approximately 70% of the digital universe is created by individuals, but enterprises are responsible for 85% of the security, privacy, reliability, and compliance. Increasingly, the proliferation of data-generating sensors and mobile computing devices, and the emergence of new forms of communication such as social networking, are driving unprecedented growth in the collection, storage and management of all types of data. Not surprisingly, this phenomenon has sparked growing demand for the ability to extract intelligence from these massive mountains of information-intelligence that can enable organizations to improve their decision-making and run their businesses more effectively and efficiently. With this capacity to rapidly sift through data and gain new insights comes a significant challenge and responsibility when it comes to personal information, or information that relates to identifiable individuals: how to enable the exchange and analysis of data, while protecting privacy. IBM has long recognized the importance of information privacy and led by example in its own privacy polices and practices: the company was the first multinational to adopt a global privacy policy in the late 1960s, and continued that leadership as recently as 2005 when it was the first company to address genetic privacy. But policies and practices are not enough on their own to address the privacy challenges of an increasingly smarter planet. Thoughtfully-designed technologies can play a key role here, part of a paradigm that some are calling Privacy by Design. As the world becomes smarter and more interconnected, the capacity to rapidly sift through data to gain new insights brings with it a significant challenge and responsibility when it comes to personal information. How do we enable the exchange and analysis of data, while protecting privacy? IBM, which in the 1960s because the first multinational to adopt a global privacy policy and in 2005 was the first to address genetic privacy, has long recognized the importance of information privacy. Leading by example in its own privacy polices and practices, IBM has also received many patents for inventions that support our commitment to privacy leadership. For example, an IBM Researcher has solved a thorny mathematical problem that has confounded scientists since the invention of public-key encryption several decades ago. The breakthrough, called ""privacy homomorphism,"" or ""fully homomorphic encryption,"" makes possible the deep and unlimited analysis of encrypted information -- data that has been intentionally scrambled -- without sacrificing confidentiality. IBM's solution, formulated by IBM Researcher Craig Gentry, uses a mathematical object called an ""ideal lattice,"" and allows people to fully interact with encrypted data in ways previously thought impossible. With the breakthrough, computer vendors storing the confidential, electronic data of others will be able to fully analyze data on their clients' behalf without expensive interaction with the client, and without seeing any of the private data. With Gentry's technique, the analysis of encrypted information can yield the same detailed results as if the original data was fully visible to all. Using the solution could help strengthen the business model of ""cloud computing,"" where a computer vendor is entrusted to host the confidential data of others in a ubiquitous Internet presence. It might better enable a cloud computing vendor to perform computations on clients' data at their request, such as analyzing sales patterns, without exposing the original data. Other potential applications include enabling filters to identify spam, even in encrypted email, or protecting information contained in electronic medical records. The breakthrough might also one day enable computer users to retrieve information from a search engine with more confidentiality"

Flor de Muertos - the Aztec Marigold, 'Cempasuchil'- the scent of marigolds forms a path the souls of the dead can follow back to the living on the annual Day of the Dead. Part documentary, part concert film, Flor, features acclaimed Americana/alternative band Calexico, playing a concert in the historic Rialto Theater to their hometown audience. Desert rat journalist Charles Bowden, who has roamed the borderlands in search of an elusive truth for decades, author Margaret Regan, artist Salvador Duran and others, comment on the insanity of American immigration policies, the blood flowing from an endless and un-winnable drug war, the uselessness of the word, 'closure', and the search for comfort in the resurgent Santa Muerte religion. Their collective voices, along with Calexico's penetrating music, make this beautifully shot documentary a mesmerizing and topical intellectual jam. The omnipresent border fence ultimately fails to divide the fertile cultural zone that is the border. Death is the great equalizing border we will all cross. With the furor over SB1070 and the border death toll climbing, this timely juxtaposition of the Day of the Dead with our immigration policies draws a line in the desert sand."

11692," Mark Twain said that ""Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts.

The Art of Being M茅tis is one part of a four-part project that also includes The Art of Being Haida, The Art of Being Inca and The Art of Being Inuit. People have a natural affinity with traditionally built water craft. We have learned in our travels, in much the same way that Twain must have experienced new people and cultures, that when you have a chance to commence a conversation with a common interest that what you may have thought of as culturally different was just another way to look at life, the earth and the community that all people can share together if we have open minds. The Art of Being M茅tis follows the making of a traditional birch bark canoe and how through the teachings of the canoe we can learn about the M茅tis and Indigenous cultures. The making of the canoe melts away and the teachings and perspectives of a culture come alive in this full feature documentary. The theme of the documentary is that we can all live in concert with Mother Nature and each other and greet each other as we really are: one tribe, one community, one people."

His hardworking, San Francisco Jewish relatives were boxing enthusiasts vaguely connected to the mob. It was these connections that got him started in the bail bonds business.

It finds him at a seeming artistic standstill about 25 years ago, living next to a trash-strewn beach in Pacifica, California. Creative by necessity, he begins collecting the detritus - especially the plastic - and assembling it into whimsical, evocative, poignant human and animal figures. Barrish reassembles his life as a sculptor but hits another snag - the art world approves the imagination but scorns the material. Barrish's beloved plastic won't do for the world of commercial galleries. In search of wider recognition, he decides to apply for a commission to create an outdoor sculpture for San Francisco's Hunter's Point.

11159," transistor A video clip as a structural model: Michaela Schwentner's video to ""Transistor"" by the Viennese music trio Radian was in a sense composed in reverse, progressing from illustrated music to an abstract blueprint which could have been used for both media. On the visual level, transistor reveals a rhythmic plan which has a close affinity to the music in its temporally distorted geometry. While most conventional visualizations in sound are superimposed to create additional sensory and intellectual levels - placing images OVER the audio - electronic production methods and their image/sound interfaces permit the use of an entirely new approach. transistor shows an excellent model for a direct coupling of sound and image. Accompanied by short, choppy segments of noise fragments, geometric gridworks appear with equal abruptness, as in a visual staccato: empty picture frames, lines and planes in varying intensities, light, semi-light, bold, extra-bold, etc. In other words, the individual validity and quality of basic elements of digital (graphic) processes are exposed in transistor. This not only places a visual matrix underneath the rasping, eruptive sound as a foundation, it also reveals the underlying matrix-like quality, the locking function in the digital culture as the interface at which graphic and acoustic elements have always overlapped. If structural film traditionally proceeded from the assumption that the visible world could be reduced to a geometric and conceptual image, Schwentner re-contextualizes such reduction processes: A kind of a dynamic structural model of an electronic culture which is crossing the genre is made visible.

Celebrated author Ezra Rosen stages a comeback after a long respite by teaching what is supposed to be an on-line writing workshop. Instead he hosts the classes at his home seeking to revitalize himself and his storytelling by seducing his young students into a cult of writing and living dangerously.

While his past achievements and charisma beguile two students in particular, it doesn't take long for most to see that the great writer has lost the plot. Before long some of the students' stories generate a meta-narrative and wrestle control from their teacher. In losing his hold on his characters and the narrative, Rosen also loses what little hold on sanity he still possesses. Yet he somehow finishes his latest novel, suggesting that perhaps there was a method to his madness."

In the documentary, Paul Hegeman follows two women. The 23-year-old Byenda who just gave birth to her third child, and the 31-year-old Aurelie, who is expecting her seventh child.

12891," In Across the Border, filmmaker Dana Plays expresses her lifelong commitment to the culture of Latin America. More specifically, her film offers the viewer an unusual insight into the complex relationship between the people of El Salvador and the United States government. Completed in 1982, during a period in which many American artists were trying to convey their anger with their own country's politics. Across the Border transcends the conventions of social documentary as we have come to know it through public television. Instead, Plays manipulates visual elements that compose the image through coloring and fragmentation. She uses this process of deconstruction to lead to a greater understanding of those ""man-made"" constructs that are responsible for the oppression she has witnessed. But Plays' message is hardly dogmatic. The subtlety of her collage-like style suggests a very open message, giving the viewer the opportunity to enter the work as a thinking human being rather than a receptacle of one person's point of view. Dana Plays' personal involvement with the people of El Salvador follows in the tradition of a cross cultural awareness expressed by other women filmmakers such as Maya Deren (Haiti), Margaret Meed (Bali, New Guinea) and Chick Strand (Mexico)."
